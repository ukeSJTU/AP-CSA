# TODO for Module8 Transformation

## Uncertainties and Questions

1. **Image Handling**: Throughout the transformation, image references (e.g., diagrams in lessons) were kept as-is in the slides with URLs. A note to download these images to the `assets/images` folder is needed. Clarification on whether these images should be downloaded or if placeholder images should be created would be helpful.

2. **Cheatsheet Handling**: The README.md for Module8 lists a cheatsheet.md file in the docs folder, but it was not processed in this transformation as it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the provided content list. Should this be included in the resources/cheatsheets folder with minimal formatting changes?

3. **External Links Documentation**: As per the task instructions, a README.md under the resources folder should list all external links used in this module with short descriptions. This was not created due to the absence of explicit external links in the processed documents. Should this be created based on a full review of all documents, or is it unnecessary if no links are found?

4. **Code Exercise Inference**: For exercises where starter code needed to be inferred (e.g., removing parts of code to create TODOs), best guesses were made based on context and instructions. If any inferred starter code does not align with the intended learning objectives, please provide feedback on specific exercises.

5. **File Naming Conventions**: For quizzes, separate files were created (e.g., `quiz.md` and `quiz_arraylists.md`) to avoid overwriting. If a different naming convention or structure is preferred, please advise.

## Actions Taken

-   All documents listed in README.md (Informational, Lessons, Quizzes, Project) were transformed into slides, source code, and resources as per the specified folder structure.
-   Code examples and exercises were extracted with starter and solution versions where applicable, maintaining the educational tone and detail.
-   Project files include starter and solution implementations with READMEs for clarity.

If there are additional materials or specific transformations not covered, please provide guidance on how to proceed.
