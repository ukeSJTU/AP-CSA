# Arrays and ArrayLists

## Introduction to Arrays

### Introduction

We have seen how to store single pieces of data in variables. What happens when we need to store a group of data? What if we have a list of students in a classroom? Or a ranking of the top 10 horses finishing a horse race?

If we were storing 5 lottery ticket numbers, for example, we could create a different variable for each value:

```
int firstNumber = 4;int secondNumber = 8;int thirdNumber = 15;int fourthNumber = 16;int fifthNumber = 23;
```

That is a lot of ungainly repeated code. What if we had a hundred lottery numbers? It is more clean and convenient to use a Java

_array_

to store the data as a list.

An array holds a fixed number of values of one type. Arrays hold `double`s, `int`s, `boolean`s, or any other primitives. Arrays can also contain `String`s as well as object references!

Each index of an array corresponds with a different value. Here is a diagram of an array filled with integer values:

![A diagram of an example int array](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/array-introduction.png)

Notice that the indexes start at 0! The element at index 0 is `4`, while the element at index 1 is `8`. This array has a length of 5, since it holds five elements, but the highest index of the array is 4.

Let’s explore how to create and use arrays in Java, so that we can store all of our Java data types.

**Instructions**

1. In this lesson, we have a `Newsfeed` class to manage trending articles with their views and ratings. Throughout this lesson, you'll learn how to create Java programs with arrays. Run the code and see how the arrays are used.

    > Hint
    > Arrays allow us to group and manage the same type of elements. Pay attention to how they are declared, initialized, and accessed. We'll learn more about this later in the lesson.

```java
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String[] robotArticles = {"Oil News", "Innovative Motors", "Humans: Exterminate Or Not?", "Organic Eye Implants", "Path Finding in an Unknown World"};
    int[] robotViewers = {87, 32, 13, 11, 7};
    double[] robotRatings = {2.5, 3.2, 5.0, 1.7, 4.3};
    Newsfeed robotTimes = new Newsfeed(robotArticles, robotViewers, robotRatings);

    robotTimes.viewArticle(2);
    robotTimes.viewArticle(2);
    System.out.println("The top article is " + robotTimes.getTopArticle());
    robotTimes.changeRating(3, 5);
  }
}
```

```java
public class Newsfeed {
    String[] trendingArticles;
    int[] views;
    double[] ratings;

    public Newsfeed(String[] initialArticles, int[] initialViews, double[] initialRatings){
      trendingArticles = initialArticles;
      views = initialViews;
      ratings = initialRatings;
    }

    public String getTopArticle(){
      return trendingArticles[0];
    }

    public void viewArticle(int articleNumber){
      views[articleNumber] = views[articleNumber] + 1;
      System.out.println("The article '" + trendingArticles[articleNumber] + "' has now been viewed " + views[articleNumber] + " times!");
    }

    public void changeRating(int articleNumber, double newRating){
      if (newRating > 5 || newRating < 0) {
        System.out.println("The rating must be between 0 and 5 stars!");
      } else {
        ratings[articleNumber] = newRating;
        System.out.println("The article '" + trendingArticles[articleNumber] + "' is now rated " + ratings[articleNumber] + " stars!");
      }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

The article 'Humans: Exterminate Or Not?' has now been viewed 14 times!
The article 'Humans: Exterminate Or Not?' has now been viewed 15 times!
The top article is Oil News
The article 'Organic Eye Implants' is now rated 5.0 stars!

## Creating an Array Explicitly

### Creating an Array Explicitly

Imagine that we’re using a program to keep track of the prices of different clothing items we want to buy. We would want a list of the prices and a list of the items they correspond to. To create an

array

, we provide a name and declare the type of data it holds:

```
double[] prices;
```

Just like with

variables

, we can declare and initialize in the same line. This allows us to explicitly initialize the array to contain the data we want to store :

```
double[] prices = {13.15, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};
```

We can use arrays to hold

`String`

s and other objects as well as primitives:

```
String[] clothingItems = {"Tank Top", "Beanie", "Funny Socks", "Corduroys"};
```

**Instructions**

1. Create a method `getTopics()` in the `Newsfeed` class that accepts no parameters, returns a `String` array, and is accessible by other classes. Leave the body empty.

    > Hint
    > Here we create a method called `getNames()` that returns an `int` array and takes no parameters:
    >
    > ```java
    > public int[] getNames(){ }
    > ```
    >
    > The method body is empty, and the method definition says it should return an `int` array, so the file won’t compile yet. We’ll fix this later.

2. Inside the `getTopics()` method, create a `String` array called `topics` that contains these elements: "Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health". Remember to keep the order the same. Then, return the `topics` array at the end of the method.

    > Hint
    > We create a String array called `names` containing these words: “Apple”, “Mango”, “Watermelon”, “Grapes”:
    >
    > ```java
    > String[] names = {"Apple", "Mango", "Watermelon", "Grapes"};
    > ```

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
  }
}
```

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  public Newsfeed(){

  }
  // Create getTopics() below:
  public String[] getTopics() {
    String[] topics = {
      "Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"
    };
    return topics;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
[Opinion, Tech, Science, Health]
```

## Importing Arrays

### Importing Arrays

When we printed out the

array

we created in the last exercise, we saw a memory address that did not help us understand what was contained in the array.

If we want to have a more descriptive printout of the array itself, we need a `toString()`

method

that is provided by the `Arrays` _package_ in Java.

```
import java.util.Arrays;
```

We put this at the top of the file, before we even define the class!

When we import a package in Java, we are making all of the methods of that package available in our code.

The `Arrays` package has many useful methods, including `Arrays.toString()`. When we pass an array into `Arrays.toString()`, we can see the contents of the array printed out:

```
import java.util.Arrays;public class Lottery(){    public static void main(String[] args){    int[] lotteryNumbers = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};    String betterPrintout = Arrays.toString(lotteryNumbers);    System.out.println(betterPrintout);  }}
```

This code will print:

```
[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

**Instructions**

1. If you run the code now, you’ll see something like `[Ljava.lang.String;@2aae9190`. This is the memory address of the array and not the actual `String` array. To make the code print the actual elements, use the `toString()` method from the `Arrays` package. Import the `Arrays` package from `java.util` at the top of the file.

    > Hint
    > Remember, we import packages in Java at the top of our file before defining the class. Here’s an example where we import the Scanner package from `java.util`:
    >
    > ```java
    > import java.util.Scanner;
    > ```

2. Now, use the `toString()` method from the `Arrays` package to print the `topics` array in the `main()` method.

    > Hint
    > Pass the `topics` array as an argument to `toString()` and use `System.out.println()` to print it.

```java
// import the Arrays package here
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(topics));
  }
}
```

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  public Newsfeed(){

  }

  public String[] getTopics(){
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
[Opinion, Tech, Science, Health]
```

## Get Element By Index

### Get Element By Index

Now that we have an

array

declared and initialized, we want to be able to get values out of it.

We use square brackets, `[` and `]`, to access data at a certain index:

```
double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};System.out.println(prices[1]);
```

This command would print:

```
15.87
```

This happens because `15.87` is the item at the `1`

index

of the array. Remember, the index of an array starts at `0` and ends at an index of one less than the number of elements in the array.

If we try to access an element outside of its appropriate index range, we will receive an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error.

For example, if we were to run the command `System.out.println(prices[5])`, we’d get the following output:

```error
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
```

**Instructions**

1. Inside the `Newsfeed` class, create a method called `getFirstTopic()` that returns a `String` and accepts no parameters. Inside the `getFirstTopic()` method, return the first element of the `topics` array.

    > Hint
    > Here’s an example where we return the 8th element of the array `names`:
    >
    > ```java
    > return names[7];
    > ```
    >
    > Remember, the first element of an array is at index 0.

2. We have added an array called `views` to keep track of how many viewers visit a topic. Every time someone views a topic, we want to increase the value of the corresponding element in `views` by 1. For example, if someone views an “Opinion” piece (index 0 in topics), we will increase the value of the 0th index of `views` by 1. Inside the `viewTopic()` method, implement this functionality. The parameter `topicIndex` represents the location of the element in `topics` that was viewed.

    > Hint
    > When an element at `topicIndex` is viewed, we increase the value of `topics[topicIndex]` by 1. Here is an example of how we can increase a value by 1:
    >
    > ```java
    > nameCount[5] = nameCount[5] + 1;
    > ```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();

    System.out.println("The top topic is " + sampleFeed.getFirstTopic());

    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(3);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(2);
    sampleFeed.viewTopic(1);

    System.out.println("The " + sampleFeed.topics[1] + " topic has been viewed " + sampleFeed.views[1] + " times!");
  }
}
```

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  public int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};

  public Newsfeed(){

  }

  public String[] getTopics(){
    return topics;
  }

  // Create getFirstTopic() below
  public String getFirstTopic() {
    return topics[0];
  }

  public void viewTopic(int topicIndex){
    views[topicIndex] += 1;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
The top topic is Opinion
The Tech topic has been viewed 3 times!
```

## Creating an Empty Array

### Creating an Empty Array

We can also create empty arrays and then fill the items one by one. Empty arrays have to be initialized with a fixed size:

```
String[] menuItems = new String[5];
```

Once you declare this size, it cannot be changed! This

array

will always be of size `5`.

After declaring and initializing, we can set each

index

of the array to be a different item:

```
menuItems[0] = "Veggie hot dog";menuItems[1] = "Potato salad";menuItems[2] = "Cornbread";menuItems[3] = "Roasted broccoli";menuItems[4] = "Coffee ice cream";
```

This group of commands has the same effect as assigning the entire array at once:

```
String[] menuItems = {"Veggie hot dog", "Potato salad", "Cornbread", "Roasted broccoli", "Coffee ice cream"};
```

We can also change an item after it has been assigned! Let’s say this restaurant is changing its broccoli dish to a cauliflower one:

```
menuItems[3] = "Baked cauliflower";
```

Now, the array looks like:

```
["Veggie hot dog", "Potato salad", "Cornbread", "Baked cauliflower", "Coffee ice cream"]
```

**Keep Reading: AP Computer Science A Students**

When we use `new` to create an empty array, each element of the array is initialized with a specific value depending on what type the element is:

Data Type

Initialized Value

int

`0`

double

`0.0`

boolean

`false`

Reference

`null`

For example, consider the following arrays:

```
String[] my_names = new String[5];int[] my_ages = new int[5];
```

Because a

`String`

is a reference to an Object, `my_names` will contain five `null`s. `my_ages` will contain five `0`s to begin with.

**Instructions**

1. We’ve declared a `String` array called `favoriteArticles` as an instance field. We’ll keep track of the user’s top 10 favorite articles in this string array. In the constructor, `Newsfeed()`, initialize `favoriteArticles` as a new empty String array of size 10.

    > Hint
    > If we want to initialize a `names` array of type `String` and size 5, we would do it like this:
    >
    > ```java
    > names = new String[5];
    > ```

2. We have created a `setFavoriteArticle()` method that accepts `favoriteIndex` and `newArticle` as parameters. Inside `setFavoriteArticle()`, set the value of the `favoriteArticles` array at index `favoriteIndex` to the value of `newArticle`. For example, if we called `setFavoriteArticle(2, "Celebrity Hands Throughout the Decades")`, the value of `favoriteArticles` at index 2 would be set to “Celebrity Hands Throughout the Decades”.

    > Hint
    > Remember that in Java, we can assign a value to a specific index of an array using the assignment operator. So, if we want to set the value of the `names` array at index 1 to the value of `newName`, we can do it like so:
    >
    > ```java
    > names[1] = newName;
    > ```

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();

    sampleFeed.setFavoriteArticle(2, "Humans: Exterminate Or Not?");
    sampleFeed.setFavoriteArticle(3, "Organic Eye Implants");
    sampleFeed.setFavoriteArticle(0, "Oil News");

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sampleFeed.favoriteArticles));
  }
}
```

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};
  String[] favoriteArticles;

  public Newsfeed(){
    // Initialize favoriteArticles here:
    favoriteArticles = new String[10];
  }

  public void setFavoriteArticle(int favoriteIndex, String newArticle){
    // Add newArticle to favoriteArticles:
    favoriteArticles[favoriteIndex] = newArticle;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
[Oil News, null, Humans: Exterminate Or Not?, Organic Eye Implants, null, null, null, null, null, null]
```

## Array Length

### Array Length

What if we have an

array

storing all the usernames for our program, and we want to quickly see how many users we have? To get the length of an array, we can access the `length` field of the array object:

```
String[] menuItems = new String[5];System.out.println(menuItems.length);
```

This command would print `5`, since the `menuItems` array has `5` slots, even though they are all empty.

If we print out the length of the `prices` array:

```
double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};System.out.println(prices.length);
```

We would see `4`, since there are four items in the `prices` array!

**Instructions**

1. We have created a method `getNumTopics()` to fetch how many topics exist in the array. Inside `getNumTopics()`, return the length of the `topics` array.

    > Hint
    > Here, we return the length of the `names` array:
    >
    > ```java
    > return names.length;
    > ```

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {

public static void main(String

Newsfeed sampleFeed = new

Newsfeed();

System.out.println("The

number of topics is "+

sampleFeed.getNumTopics());

}

}

```java
public class Newsfeed {
  String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
  int[] views = {0, 0, 0, 0};

  public Newsfeed(){

  }

  public String[] getTopics(){
    return topics;
  }

  public int getNumTopics(){
    return topics.length;
  }

}
```

**Output:**

```
The number of topics is 4
```

## String[] args

### String[] args

When we write `main()` methods for our programs, we use the

parameter

`String[] args`. Now that we know about

array

syntax, we can start to parse what this means.

A `String[]` is an array made up of

`String`

s. Examples of `String` arrays:

```
String[] humans = {"Talesha", "Gareth", "Cassie", "Alex"};String[] robots = {"R2D2", "Marvin", "Bender", "Ava"};
```

The `args` parameter is another example of a `String` array. In this case, the array `args` contains the arguments that we pass in from the

terminal

when we run the class file. (So far, `args` has been empty.)

So how can you pass arguments to `main()`? Let’s say we have this class `HelloYou`:

```
public class HelloYou {  public static void main(String[] args) {    System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);    }}
```

When we run the file `HelloYou` in the terminal with an

argument

of `"Laura"`:

```
java HelloYou Laura
```

We get the output:

```
Hello Laura
```

The `String[] args` would be interpreted as an array with one element, `"Laura"`.

When we use `args[0]` in the main

method

, we can access that element like we did in `HelloYou`.

**Instructions**

1. Let’s make users have the option to personalize the Newsfeed object for either robots or humans. The `main()` method will take either “Robot” or “Human” as an argument when we run the file. If the `args[0]` array holds “Human”, we will initialize the feed with human topics. If the `args[0]` array holds “Robot”, we will initialize the feed with robot topics. In the conditional statement, check if the `args` has the value `Robot` or not.

    > Hint
    > Remember `args` is a String array. In Java, this is how we check if two strings are equal:
    >
    > ```java
    > string1.equals(string2);
    > ```

2. In the terminal, run the program with the argument `Robot`.

    > Hint
    > Remember that to run programs from the command line, we use syntax like so:
    >
    > ```bash
    > java programName argument1 argument2 argument3
    > ```
    >
    > In this case, the program name is `Main` and we use `Robot` as the argument.

3. Now, run the program with the argument `Human`.

    > Hint
    > To run programs from the command line, we use the following syntax:
    >
    > ```bash
    > java programName argument1 argument2 argument3
    > ```
    >
    > In this case, the program name is `Main` and we use `Human` as the argument.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
		Newsfeed feed;
    // if (/*Replace this comment with code for checkpoint 1*/)
    if(args[0].equals("Robot")){
      //topics for a Robot feed:
      String[] robotTopics = {"Oil", "Parts", "Algorithms", "Love"};
      feed = new Newsfeed(robotTopics);
    }
    else if(args[0].equals("Human")){
      //topics for a Human feed:
      String[] humanTopics = {"Politics", "Science", "Sports", "Love"};
			feed = new Newsfeed(humanTopics);
    }
    else{
      String[] genericTopics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
      feed = new Newsfeed(genericTopics);
    }

    System.out.println("The topics in this feed are:");
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(feed.topics));
  }
}

```

```java
public class Newsfeed {

  String[] topics;

  public Newsfeed(String[] initialTopics){
		topics = initialTopics;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
The topics in this feed are:
[Oil, Parts, Algorithms, Love]

The topics in this feed are:
[Politics, Science, Sports, Love]
```

## Review

### Review

We have now seen how to store a list of values in arrays. We can use this knowledge to make organized programs with more complex

variables

.

Throughout the lesson, we have learned about:

-   Creating arrays explicitly, using `{` and `}`.
-   Accessing an

index

    of an

array

    using `[` and `]`.

-   Creating empty arrays of a certain size, and filling the indices one by one.
-   Getting the length of an array using `length`.
-   Using the

argument

    array `args` that is passed into the `main()`

method

    of a class.

**Instructions**

1. Let’s practice what we’ve learned throughout this lesson. First, inside `main()`, create a String array `students` and initialize it with these elements: “Sade”, “Alexus”, “Sam”, “Koma”.

    > Hint
    > We create a String array called `games` using the new keyword followed by the type of data the array:
    >
    > ```java
    > String[] games = {"Cricket", "Football", "Skating", "Bowling"};
    > ```

2. Now, to store the scores of the recent math test, create an array called `mathScores` of type `int` and set it to an empty array of size 4. Each spot in this array will represent the math test score of the student in the corresponding spot in the `students` array. For example, `mathScores[2]` will represent the score of `students[2]` which is “Sam”.

    > Hint
    > Here is an example of how we can create an empty array of seven elements in Java:
    >
    > ```java
    > int[] someArray = new int[7];
    > ```

3. The students had the following scores on their most recent math test: Sade got a 64, Sam got a 76, Alexus got a 57, Koma got a 98. Store these values in the appropriate spots in the `mathScores` array.

    > Hint
    > Here is how we can update values in an array in Java. The following code updates the 4th element:
    >
    > ```java
    > someArray[3] = someNewValue;
    > ```
    >
    > Remember that array indices start at 0, so the 0th index is the first position in the array.

4. Print out the math scores of each student. Print each score on a new line and use the following format: Scott: 88.

    > Hint
    > We can use `System.out.println()` for this task.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[] students = {"Sade", "Alexus", "Sam", "Koma"};
    int[] mathScores = new int[4];
    mathScores[0] = 64;
    mathScores[2] = 76;
    mathScores[1] = 57;
    mathScores[3] = 98;
    System.out.println(students[0] + ": " + mathScores[0]);
    System.out.println(students[1] + ": " + mathScores[1]);
    System.out.println(students[2] + ": " + mathScores[2]);
    System.out.println(students[3] + ": " + mathScores[3]);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Sade: 64
Alexus: 57
Sam: 76
Koma: 98
```
