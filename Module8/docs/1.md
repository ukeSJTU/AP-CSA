# Arrays and ArrayLists

# Welcome to Arrays and Loops

Let’s look at what’s coming up in this section of the path.

So far, all of our variables have held one value; we could have an `int` variable hold the value `5`. In this section of the path, we’ll learn how we can store _multiple_ values in a single variable using Arrays and ArrayLists.

Furthermore, we’ll learn how to quickly look at all of the different values we’re storing in Arrays and ArrayLists using Loops.

Finally, we’ll look at how we can have Arrays of Arrays — also known as two-dimensional arrays.

These three topics are core ideas in almost every programming language. Take your time to truly grasp the topics introduced in this section!

Let’s get started!
