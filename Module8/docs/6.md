# Desert Island Playlist Project

## Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java) by building a playlist of your favorite music using Java `Arrays` and `ArrayList`.

## Project Brief

Suppose you're heading to a desert island, cut off from the world, for the next few days. Luckily, you can bring a playlist of your favorite music. This project is a chance to apply your Java skills to build `Playlist.java`, a program to store and customize the best possible music playlist using `Arrays` and `ArrayList`. You'll add your favorite songs and use various functions to manipulate the playlist.

## Tasks

### Create Your Playlist

1. **Add a `main()` Method and Import Libraries**

    - Add a `main()` method to the `Playlist` class in the `Playlist.java` file.
    - Import `Arrays` and `ArrayList` from `java.util` since we'll be working with them.

    > **Hint**  
    > For example, to import `LinkedList` from `java.util`, you would write:
    >
    > ```java
    > import java.util.LinkedList;
    > ```

2. **Create an Array of Favorite Songs**

    - Inside `main()` of the `Playlist.java` file, create an array `favoriteSongs` that can hold `String` values and initialize it with your 10 favorite songs. Each element should be in the format "Artist - Song Title". For example: `"Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody"`.

    > **Hint**  
    > Here, we create an array called `favoriteDogs` of type `String` that holds 10 different dog breeds:
    >
    > ```java
    > String[] favoriteDogs = {"Maltese", "Cavachon", "German Shepherd", "Beagle", "Poodle", "Bulldog", "Boxer", "Siberian Husky", "Dachshund", "Shih Tzu"};
    > ```

3. **Print the First Three Songs**

    - Print the first three songs in your `favoriteSongs` array.

    > **Hint**  
    > Here is an example of how to access and print elements of an array:
    >
    > ```java
    > // print first element of someArray
    > System.out.println(someArray[0]);
    > ```

4. **Create an ArrayList for Desert Island Playlist**

    - Add an `ArrayList` called `desertIslandPlaylist` to store `String` values.

    > **Hint**  
    > Here, we create an `ArrayList` called `dogNames` of type `String`:
    >
    > ```java
    > ArrayList<String> dogNames = new ArrayList<>();
    > ```

5. **Add Songs to Desert Island Playlist**

    - Use the `add()` method of the `ArrayList` class to add 5 of your favorite songs to `desertIslandPlaylist`. Remember to add songs that are not present in the `favoriteSongs` array.

    > **Hint**  
    > For example, to add "Daisy" to `ArrayList` `dogNames`, you would do it like so:
    >
    > ```java
    > dogNames.add("Daisy");
    > ```

6. **Print the Desert Island Playlist**

    - Print `desertIslandPlaylist` to the terminal to see what your playlist looks like.

    > **Hint**  
    > Here's an example of how to print `dogNames`:
    >
    > ```java
    > System.out.println(dogNames);
    > ```

### Add and Remove Songs

7. **Add All Favorite Songs to Desert Island Playlist**

    - Add all the songs from `favoriteSongs` to `desertIslandPlaylist`:
        - Use the `Arrays.asList()` method and pass the `favoriteSongs` array to convert it into a list.
        - Add this list to `desertIslandPlaylist` using the `addAll()` method.

    > **Hint**  
    > For example, this is how to add all breeds from the array `favoriteDogs` to `ArrayList` `dogNames`:
    >
    > ```java
    > dogNames.addAll(Arrays.asList(favoriteDogs));
    > ```

8. **Check the Number of Songs in the Playlist**

    - Use the `size()` method to get the number of songs on your `desertIslandPlaylist` and print it to the terminal.

    > **Hint**  
    > Check out this example to get the size of an `ArrayList` called `dogNames`:
    >
    > ```java
    > dogNames.size();
    > ```

9. **Remove Songs to Keep Top 5**

    - Since you can only bring five songs, remove the rest of your least favorite songs from `desertIslandPlaylist` using the `remove()` method until you have only 5 songs left.

    > **Hint**  
    > Here, we remove the dog breed "Golden Retriever" from `dogNames`:
    >
    > ```java
    > dogNames.remove("Golden Retriever");
    > ```

### Swap Songs

10. **Review the Current Playlist**

    -   Run the code to print the `desertIslandPlaylist` which contains your top 5 favorite songs.

11. **Get Indices of Songs to Swap**

    -   Select two songs and get their indices using the `indexOf()` method. Call these songs `Song A` and `Song B` and store their indices in variables.

    > **Hint**  
    > Check out this example to get the index of "Golden Retriever" in the `dogNames` ArrayList and store it in the variable `indexD`:
    >
    > ```java
    > int indexD = dogNames.indexOf("Golden Retriever");
    > ```

12. **Store Song A Temporarily**

    -   Create a `String` variable called `tempA` and assign it the value of `Song A`.

    > **Hint**  
    > Here we create a `String` variable called `tempBreed` and assign it the value of "Border Collie":
    >
    > ```java
    > String tempBreed = "Border Collie";
    > ```

13. **Replace Song A with Song B**

    -   Use the `set()` method on `desertIslandPlaylist` to replace `Song A` with `Song B`. Print the `ArrayList` `desertIslandPlaylist` to see `Song B` appearing twice in the playlist.

14. **Complete the Swap**
    -   Call `set()` on `desertIslandPlaylist` again with the index of `Song B` and the temporary `String` variable `tempA` to put `Song A` where `Song B` used to be. Print the playlist to see the songs swapped from their original positions.

### Remix!

15. **Explore Further**
    -   You've successfully built your desert island playlist using arrays and `ArrayList`s! Consider additional ideas:
        -   Build another desert island playlist for food recipes, movies, or TV shows.
        -   Create a method that shuffles the song order.
        -   Reverse the song order.

## Sample Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Playlist {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] favoriteSongs = {
            "The Beatles - Hey Jude",
            "Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody",
            "Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven",
            "Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb",
            "Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
            "Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit",
            "Bob Dylan - Like a Rolling Stone",
            "Radiohead - Paranoid Android",
            "David Bowie - Space Oddity",
            "Fleetwood Mac - Dreams"
        };

        // Task 3: Print first three songs
        System.out.println(favoriteSongs[0]);
        System.out.println(favoriteSongs[1]);
        System.out.println(favoriteSongs[2]);

        ArrayList<String> desertIslandPlaylist = new ArrayList<>();
        desertIslandPlaylist.add("Daft Punk - Get Lucky");
        desertIslandPlaylist.add("The Weeknd - Blinding Lights");
        desertIslandPlaylist.add("Tame Impala - The Less I Know The Better");
        desertIslandPlaylist.add("Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know?");
        desertIslandPlaylist.add("Kendrick Lamar - HUMBLE.");

        System.out.println(desertIslandPlaylist);

        desertIslandPlaylist.addAll(Arrays.asList(favoriteSongs));

        System.out.println(desertIslandPlaylist.size());
    }
}
```

## Output

```
The Beatles - Hey Jude
Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody
Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven
[Daft Punk - Get Lucky, The Weeknd - Blinding Lights, Tame Impala - The Less I Know The Better, Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know?, Kendrick Lamar - HUMBLE.]
```
