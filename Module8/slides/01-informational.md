# Arrays and ArrayLists

## Welcome to Arrays and Loops

-   In this module, we'll explore storing multiple values in a single variable using **Arrays** and **ArrayLists**.
-   We'll learn how to iterate through these values using **Loops**.
-   We'll also cover **two-dimensional arrays** (Arrays of Arrays).
-   These concepts are fundamental in almost every programming language.

# Learning Objectives

-   Understand how to use Arrays and ArrayLists to store multiple values.
-   Master the use of Loops to access and manipulate data in collections.
-   Grasp the concept of two-dimensional arrays for complex data structures.
