# Desert Island Playlist Project

## Objective

-   Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam by building a playlist of your favorite music using Java `Arrays` and `ArrayList`.

---

# Project Brief

-   You're heading to a desert island for a few days and can bring a playlist of your favorite music.
-   Build `Playlist.java` to store and customize a music playlist using `Arrays` and `ArrayList`.
-   Add favorite songs and manipulate the playlist with various functions.

---

# Tasks: Create Your Playlist

-   **Add `main()` Method and Import Libraries**: Include `main()` in `Playlist` class and import `Arrays` and `ArrayList`.
-   **Create Array of Favorite Songs**: Initialize `favoriteSongs` with 10 songs in "Artist - Song Title" format.
-   **Print First Three Songs**: Display the first three songs from `favoriteSongs`.
-   **Create ArrayList for Desert Island Playlist**: Initialize `desertIslandPlaylist` for `String` values.
-   **Add Songs to Desert Island Playlist**: Add 5 unique favorite songs to `desertIslandPlaylist`.
-   **Print Desert Island Playlist**: Show the current playlist content.

## Key Concepts

-   Using `Arrays` for fixed-size lists.
-   Using `ArrayList` for dynamic lists with `add()`.

---

# Tasks: Add and Remove Songs

-   **Add All Favorite Songs**: Use `Arrays.asList()` and `addAll()` to add all `favoriteSongs` to `desertIslandPlaylist`.
-   **Check Number of Songs**: Use `size()` to print the total number of songs in `desertIslandPlaylist`.
-   **Remove Songs to Keep Top 5**: Use `remove()` to reduce `desertIslandPlaylist` to your top 5 songs.

## Key Concepts

-   Combining lists with `addAll()`.
-   Managing list size with `size()` and `remove()`.

---

# Tasks: Swap Songs

-   **Review Current Playlist**: Print `desertIslandPlaylist` with top 5 songs.
-   **Get Indices of Songs to Swap**: Use `indexOf()` to find positions of two songs to swap.
-   **Store Song A Temporarily**: Save one song in a temporary variable.
-   **Replace Song A with Song B**: Use `set()` to replace one song with another.
-   **Complete the Swap**: Use `set()` again to place the temporary song in the other position.

## Key Concepts

-   Finding positions with `indexOf()`.
-   Updating positions with `set()` for swapping elements.

# Tasks: Remix!

-   **Explore Further**: Consider additional ideas:
    -   Build playlists for food recipes, movies, or TV shows.
    -   Create a method to shuffle song order.
    -   Reverse the song order.

## Key Concepts

-   Extending concepts to other domains.
-   Experimenting with list manipulation techniques.
