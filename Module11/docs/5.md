# Java Code Challenge: Using Loops With Strings

Put your knowledge of String traversal to the test with these code challenges.

## String Traversal

`String`s are objects that hold text-based information. Did you know we can also iterate through a `String` using a loop? That‚Äôs right- similar to arrays and `ArrayList`s, we can traverse a String in order to access each individual element.

This ability to traverse a `String` can be extremely useful. For example, an attempt was made to copy and send over the full poem of ‚ÄúThe Raven‚Äù by Edgar Allan Poe; however, it was reported that two of the stanzas showed up like this:

```
".<romr<v<N" sa <man hcus htiW¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†,rood r<bmahc sih <voba tsub d<rutplucs <ht nopu tsa<b ro driB‚Äîrood r<bmahc sih <voba drib gni<<s htiw d<ss<lb saw t<y r<v<¬†¬†¬†¬†gni<b namuh gnivil on taht gni<<rga pl<h tonnac <w roF¬†¬†¬†¬†;<rob ycnav<l<r <lttil‚Äîgnina<m <lttil r<wsna sti hguohT,ylnialp os <sruocsid ra<h ot lwof ylniagnu siht d<ll<vram I¬†hcuM¬†¬†¬†¬†".<romr<v<N" n<vaR <ht htouQ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†"!<rohs nainotulP s'thgiN <ht no si <man yldrol yht tahw <m ll<T‚Äî<rohs ylthgiN <ht morf gnir<dnaw n<vaR tn<icna dna mirg yltsahG,n<varc on <rus tra" ,dias I¬†",uoht ,n<vahs dna nrohs <b ts<rc yht hguohT",<row ti <cnan<tnuoc <ht fo muroc<d nr<ts dna <varg <ht yB,gnilims otni ycnaf das ym gniliug<b drib ynob< siht n<hT
```

We‚Äôve been tasked with resolving the problem using String traversal. Let‚Äôs get started!

### Create a new string with the characters reversed

The first known issue is that the poem text became reversed. We‚Äôll use an algorithm to reverse all the characters. We‚Äôll need to take the following steps:

1.  Declare a new, empty `String` to store the reversed text.
2.  Create a `for` loop that will iterate through every value of our `String`.
3.  Inside the loop, grab a single element at the `String` index of the current iteration.
4.  Also within the loop, update the new `String` by prepending the current element‚Äôs value to the current `String` value.
5.  Return the new `String` once the loop is complete.

Coding question

## Questions

Complete the function `reverseString()` which has one parameter: `String text`. The function must return a `String` which stores the characters of `text` in reverse. For example, if the method is called with the argument `"abc"`, it should return `"cba"`.

To accomplish this, you will need to use a `for` loop to traverse `text`.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
class Reverse {
  public static String reverseString(String text) {
    // Add your code below
    String reversed = new String("");

   for (int i=0; i < text.length(); i++){
      char nextCharacter = text.charAt(i);
      reversed = nextCharacter + reversed;
    }
    return reversed;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String text = new String("\".<romr<v<N\" sa <man hcus htiW\n ,rood r<bmahc sih <voba tsub d<rutplucs <ht nopu tsa<b ro driB ‚Äîrood r<bmahc sih <voba drib gni<<s htiw d<ss<lb saw t<y r<v< gni<b namuh gnivil on taht gni<<rga pl<h tonnac <w roF ;<rob ycnav<l<r <lttil‚Äîgnina<m <lttil r<wsna sti hguohT ,ylnialp os <sruocsid ra<h ot lwof ylniagnu siht d<ll<vram I hcuM\n\n\".<romr<v<N\" n<vaR <ht htouQ\n \"!<rohs nainotulP s‚ÄôthgiN <ht no si <man yldrol yht tahw <m ll<T ‚Äî<rohs ylthgiN <ht morf gnir<dnaw n<vaR tn<icna dna mirg yltsahG ,n<varc on <rus tra\" ,dias I \",uoht ,n<vahs dna nrohs <b ts<rc yht hguohT\",<row ti <cnan<tnuoc <ht fo muroc<d nr<ts dna <varg <ht yB ,gnilims otni ycnaf das ym gniliug<b drib ynob< siht n<hT");

Let‚Äôs walk through this solution:

```
public static String reverseString(String text) {¬†¬†String reversed =¬†new String(""); ¬†¬†for (int i=0; i < text.length(); i++){¬†¬†¬†¬†char nextCharacter =¬†text.charAt(i);¬†¬†¬†¬†reversed =¬†nextCharacter +¬†reversed;¬†¬†}¬†¬†return reversed;}
```

We first create an empty `String` called `reversed`\- we‚Äôll use this `String` to store the reversed value of `text`.

Then, we create a `for` loop. We want to iterate through each value of `text`; therefore, we set our loop header to continue to iterate until `i < text.length()`.

Inside our loop, we create a `char` variable called `nextCharacter` and assign it to store the current element value of `text` using this code: `nextCharacter = text.charAt(i);`

The last thing we do in our loop is to update the value of `reversed` with the code `reversed = nextCharacter + reversed;` This will place the current element value (stored in `nextCharacter`) at the beginning of our `reversed` variable. Doing this creates our new, reversed `String`. Finally, outside the loop, we return the value of `reversed`.

### Find if one or more substrings has a particular property

Ah, this is a lot easier to read now. The other issue we‚Äôve come across is that every `e` was somehow replaced with the symbol `<`. In order to take every `<` in our `String` and replace it with `e`, we‚Äôll have to do the following:

1.  Create a loop that iterates through every element of our `String`.
2.  Check if the element is equivalent to the character we want to replace.
3.  If the above condition is true, replace the element with a new value. To do this, we will update our String to equal the following: a substring of all the values before that element‚Äôs index value + the replacement value + a substring of all the values that appear after that element‚Äôs index.
4.  Outside the loop, return the value of our `String`.

Coding question

## Questions

Complete the function `replaceCharacter()`. The function takes in three parameters: `String text`, `char charToReplace`, and `char replacement`.

The function must return `text` with every `charToReplace` value inside it replaced with `replacement`.

For example, if we called the function `replaceCharacter("abracadabra", 'a', 'i')`, the function should return `"ibricidibri"`.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
class Replace {
  public static String replaceCharacter(String text, char charToReplace, char replacement) {
    // Add your code below
    for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++){
      if (text.charAt(i) == charToReplace) {
        text = text.substring(0, i) + replacement + text.substring(i+1);
      }
  }
    return text;

  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String text = "Th<n this <bony bird b<guiling my sad fancy into smiling, By th< grav< and st<rn d<corum of th< count<nanc< it wor<,\"Though thy cr<st b< shorn and shav<n, thou,\" I said, \"art sur< no crav<n, Ghastly grim and anci<nt Rav<n wand<ring from th< Nightly shor<‚Äî T<ll m< what thy lordly nam< is on th< Night's Plutonian shor<!\" \nQuoth th< Rav<n \"N<v<rmor<.\"\n\nMuch I marv<ll<d this ungainly fowl to h<ar discours< so plainly, Though its answ<r littl< m<aning‚Äîlittl< r<l<vancy bor<; For w< cannot h<lp agr<<ing that no living human b<ing <v<r y<t was bl<ss<d with s<<ing bird abov< his chamb<r door‚Äî Bird or b<ast upon th< sculptur<d bust abov< his chamb<r door, \nWith such nam< as \"N<v<rmor<.\"";
    System.out.println(replaceCharacter(text, '<', 'e'));

  }
}
```

Output:

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore‚Äî Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning‚Äîlittle relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door‚Äî Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as "Nevermore."

Let‚Äôs review how we accomplished the above task:

```
public static String replaceCharacter(String text, char charToReplace, char replacement) {¬†¬†for (int i =¬†0; i < text.length(); i++){¬†¬†¬†¬†if (text.charAt(i) == charToReplace) {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†text =¬†text.substring(0, i) +¬†replacement +¬†text.substring(i+1);¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†} }¬†¬†return text; }
```

We have three parameters:

-   `String text` - This will hold a `String` value that we will iterate through.
-   `char charToReplace` - This is the character we will be searching for in order to replace it.
-   `char replacement` - This is the character we will use to replace `charToReplace` in our `String`.

First, we create a loop that loops from `0` until `i < text.length()`. Inside the loop, we use an `if` statement to check if the element at the index of the current iteration is equivalent to the value of `charToReplace`: `text.charAt(i) == charToReplace`

If the condition is `true` we need to update the value of `text` to replace the `charToReplace` value with `replacement`. For this, we use the code `text = text.substring(0, i) + replacement + text.substring(i+1);`.

We recreate `text` by concatenating three values. The first value, `text.substring(0, i)`, will create a substring containing every element that came before the current index. The second value is `replacement`. The third value, `text.substring(i+1)` is a substring of every element in `text` that appears after the current index. By concatenating them with `+`, the `charToReplace` value at that index is replaced with `replacement`. Outside the loop, we return `text`.

Remember that `String`s are immutable; this means that their value cannot be changed. Every time we replace a character, we are creating a brand new `String`.

### Determine the number of substrings that meet specific criteria

#### Part 1

Something interesting about ‚ÄúThe Raven‚Äù is its use of dialogue. How many lines of dialogue are present in the entire poem? To find out, we‚Äôll need to do the following:

1.  Create a counter variable and set its initial value to `0`.
2.  Loop through each element of the `String`.
3.  Check if the `char` type element is equivalent to a quotation mark (`"`).
4.  If the condition above is true, increase the counter by `1`.
5.  Outside the loop, divide the counter variable by `2`.
6.  Return the counter variable.

Coding question

## Questions

Complete the function `findNumberOfQuotes()` that takes in the parameter `String text` and returns an `int` value that represents the number of quotes in `text`.

For example, if we called `findNumberOfQuotes("/"Hello there,/" said Codey, /"How are you?/"")`, the function would return `2`.

Remember, each quote is enclosed in two quotation marks and `/"` is an escape sequence that allows a quote (`"`) to appear within a `String`.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
class Count {

  public static int findNumberOfQuotes(String text) {
    // Add your code below
    int numQuotes = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++){
      if (text.charAt(i) == '"') {
        numQuotes += 1;
      }
    }
    numQuotes /= 2;
    return numQuotes;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String text = "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore‚ÄîWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\"‚ÄôTis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door‚Äî\nOnly this and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.

Let‚Äôs go over the following solution:

```
public static int findNumberOfQuotes(String text) {¬†¬†int numQuotes =¬†0;¬†¬†for (int i =¬†0; i < text.length(); i++){¬†¬†¬†¬†if (text.charAt(i) == '"') {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†numQuotes += 1;¬†¬†¬†¬†}¬†¬†}¬†¬†numQuotes /= 2;¬†¬†return numQuotes;}
```

We first create `numQuotes` which will act as our counter variable. Then, we create a `for` loop that will iterate from `0` until `i < text.length()`.

Then, we check if the current element value is a quotation mark using the condition `text.charAt(i) == '"'` We can also choose to use an escape sequence (`\"`) as our condition. If we were searching for a `String` value instead of a `char` value, we would need to use `\"` because just `"` would have closed our `String`; using the escape sequence alerts the compiler that we will be searching for `"` as a value.

If the condition is true, we increase `numQuotes` by `1`. Outside the loop, we use the `/=` compound assignment operator to divide the value of `numQuotes` by `2`. We do this because a single quote is enclosed in two quotation marks (`"`). With this as our final value, we return `numQuotes`.

#### Part 2

One of the most repeated words in the poem is ‚ÄúNevermore‚Äù. Just how many times is it used throughout ‚ÄúThe Raven‚Äù? Here‚Äôs what we can do to find out:

1.  Create a counter variable and set its initial value to `0`.
2.  Loop through the `String`. In order to prevent an `indexOutOfBounds` error, we need to start the loop at the beginning of the `String`, but end the iteration before the loop control variable is equal to the length of the `String` minus the length of the `String` value we are searching for.
3.  In each iteration, check if the current element and the next several element values are equivalent to the text we are searching for. If it is, increase the counter variable by `1`.
4.  Return the counter variable.

## Questions

Complete the function `findNumValues()` which contains a `String` parameter called `text` and a `String` parameter called `textToFind`.

By that Heaven that bends above us‚Äîby that God we both adore‚Äî Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore‚ÄîClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting‚Äî\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night‚Äôs Plutonian shore!Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!Leave my loneliness unbroken!‚Äîquit the bust above my door!Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\nQuoth the Raven \"Nevermore.\"\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon‚Äôs that is dreaming,And the lamp-light o‚Äôer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted‚Äînevermore!";

Let‚Äôs walk through how we completed this particular challenge:

```
public static int findNumValues(String text, String findText) {¬†¬†int count =¬†0;¬†¬†for (int i =¬†0; i <= text.length()-findText.length(); i++){¬†¬†¬†¬†if (text.substring(i, i +¬†findText.length()).equalsIgnoreCase(findText)) {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†count += 1¬†¬†¬†¬†}¬†¬†}¬†¬†return count;}
```

We have three variables:

-   `text` - this variable contains the `String` we will search through.
-   `findText` - this variable is used to store the `String` value we are searching for.
-   `count` - this variable will store the number of times we find `findText` in `text`.

Our loop header looks a little different than usual. The loop control variable will start at `0` and continue to increase by `1` until it equals the value of the length of `text` minus the length of `"findText"`. Why subtract this? This has to do with the condition in our `if` statement.

Our `if` statement‚Äôs condition is `text.substring(i, i + findText.length()).equalsIgnoreCase(findText)`. This condition checks if the current element value and the succeeding several element values is equivalent to the value of `findText`. Since a `String` is an object, we will use the `equalsIgnoreCase()` function to compare if two values are equal.

We used a substring to select the current element value as well as the additional elements: `text.substring(i, i + findText.length())`. The length of `findText` determines how many of the succeeding elements will be included in the substring.

Here‚Äôs a question - what would happen if we were on the final iteration of our loop and tried to check what the next several element values of our `String` were?

If you guessed that we would get an error, you‚Äôre correct. `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors occur when we try to select an element that exists outside the range of our `String`. This is why our loop stops iterating when `i <= text.length()-findText.length() + 1`. If, for example, `findText.length()` is `9`, we don‚Äôt need to check what the last eight element values are because there‚Äôs no way that substring will be equivalent to `findText`.

If the substring‚Äôs value did equal the value of `findText`, we increased the value of `count` by `1`. Outside the loop, we can return the value of `count`.

### Conclusion

Great job reaching the end of these code challenges. Let‚Äôs go over what we accomplished by using loops with `String`s:

-   We created an algorithm that can create a new `String` containing the reversed value of another `String`.
-   We used a loop to iterate through a `String` in order to identify if a substring contained a particular property.
-   We determined the number of times a substring possessed a certain criterion by traversing a `String`.
