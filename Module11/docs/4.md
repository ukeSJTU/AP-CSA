# Java Code Challenge: Loops Involving ArrayLists

Practice looping through ArrayLists with these code challenges!

`ArrayList`s hold data in a very similar way to arrays, but the biggest difference is that `ArrayList`s have a layer of abstraction built on top of arrays. This layer helps to make `ArrayList`s easier to use as the size of the array is no longer fixed, but can be dynamically resized as needed. Just like arrays, we can also use loops to traverse `ArrayList`s.

The problems presented in this code challenge are designed to give you practice looping through `ArrayList`s of objects. If you are looking for more practice with `ArrayList`s of primitive data types and `Strings`, take a look at our array loop code challenges and use `ArrayList`s instead of arrays.

Say you are a beekeeper and each bee in your beehive is represented by your `Bee` class:

```
public class Bee {  private String name;  private boolean isHome;  public Bee(String name) {    this.name = name;    this.isHome = true;  }  public String getName() {    return this.name;  }  public void setName(String newName) {    this.name = newName;  }  public boolean isHome() {    return this.isHome;  }  public void leaveHome() {    this.isHome = false;  }  public void returnHome() {    this.isHome = true;  }}
```

We could use an `ArrayList` to keep track of all the bees in our hive.

```
import java.util.ArrayList;public class BeeHive {  private ArrayList<Bee> beeList;  public BeeHive(int numBees) {    this.beeList = new ArrayList<Bee>();    for (int i = 0; i < numBees; i++) {      this.beeList.add(new Bee("bee" + i));    }  }  public static void main(String[] args) {    BeeHive myHive = new BeeHive(365);  }}
```

### 1\. Print bee names

Coding question

## Questions

Write a method named printBees() that prints out the name of every bee in the bee list. Each name should be on its own line. For example:

```pseudo
bee0
bee1
bee2
bee3
...
```

Hint

You can access a bee’s name using its `.getName()` method.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BeeHive {
  private ArrayList<Bee> beeList;

  public BeeHive(int numBees) {
    this.beeList = new ArrayList<Bee>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numBees; i++) {
      this.beeList.add(new Bee("bee" + i));
    }
  }

  public void printBees() {


  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BeeHive myHive = new BeeHive(365);
    myHive.printBees();
  }
}
```

Solution

Let's take a look at one solution for this challenge.

```
public void printBees() {  for (Bee b : this.beeList) {    System.out.println(b.getName());  }}
```

We decided to use an enhanced for loop to get direct access to each Bee. We then use the accessor method `getName()` to get the Bee’s name.

### 2\. Scavenger bee

Coding question

## Questions

A scavenger bee has to leave for an expedition! Given the name of the bee that has to leave home, update the corresponding bee in the `beeList` to be away.

Each bee has an `isHome` property that determines where the bee is. To update this property to `false`, you can call the bee’s `.leaveHome()` method.

Hint

How would you manually find this bee in the `beeList` to call its `.leaveHome()` method?

Hint

Remember, string comparisons can be done with the string’s `.equals()` method, which returns `true` if the two strings are equal, and `false` otherwise.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BeeHive {
  private ArrayList<Bee> beeList;

  public BeeHive(int numBees) {
    this.beeList = new ArrayList<Bee>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numBees; i++) {
      this.beeList.add(new Bee("bee" + i));
    }
  }

  public ArrayList<Bee> getBeeList() {
    return this.beeList;
  }

  public void leaveHome(String beeName) {


  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BeeHive myHive = new BeeHive(365);
    myHive.leaveHome("bee43");

    // Print bee's status to make sure it is no longer home
    System.out.println(myHive.beeList.get(43).isHome());
  }
}
```

```
public void leaveHome(String beeName) {  for (Bee b : this.beeList) {    if (b.getName().equals(beeName)) {      b.leaveHome();    }  }}
```

In order to see if we have the right Bee, we use the `equals()` method to compare every Bee’s name to the name we’re looking for.

### 3\. Moving in

Coding question

## Questions

Last night our Queen Bee had a long stay at the bee maternity ward! This morning we discovered that she added new members to our bee hive! Given an `ArrayList` of the names for our new bees, write a method, `.addBees()` to add the new bees into our `beeList` family.

Hint

When you create a new `Bee` instance, you will want to pass in the name string to the constructor so that the new bee is created with the name.

Hint

The `ArrayList` has an `.add()` method which expects an element. It will insert the element at the end of the list and update the list’s size.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BeeHive {
  private ArrayList<Bee> beeList;

  public BeeHive(int numBees) {
    this.beeList = new ArrayList<Bee>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numBees; i++) {
      this.beeList.add(new Bee("bee" + i));
    }
  }

  public ArrayList<Bee> getBeeList() {
    return this.beeList;
  }

  public void addBees(ArrayList<String> beeNames) {


  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BeeHive myHive = new BeeHive(3);
    ArrayList<String> newBees = new ArrayList<String>();
    newBees.add("bob");
    newBees.add("macey");
    newBees.add("anna");

    myHive.addBees(newBees);

    // Print out the elements in the bee list to make sure the new bees were added
    for (Bee b : myHive.beeList) {
      System.out.println(b.getName());
    }
  }
}
```

Solution

```
public void addBees(ArrayList<String> beeNames) {  for (String name : beeNames) {    this.beeList.add(new Bee(name));  }}
```

This time we’re not looping through the `beeList`. Instead, we’re looping through the ArrayList of names given to us. We need to use the Bee constructor to create a new Bee for every name in that list.

### 4\. Moving out

Coding question

## Questions

Some of the bees wanted to move out of the hive to make room for new family members. In `.moveOutBees()`, remove every other bee in the list of bees, starting with the first bee.

Hint

The `ArrayList` has a `.remove()` method that will allow you to remove the element at the given index. The list will then update in size.

Hint

When iterating through the list, how would the list be altered when you remove an element? What would be the next element in the iteration if the previous element was removed?

After you remove the bee at the 0th index, the second bee is now at the 0th index, and the third bee is at the 1st index. At what index is the next bee that we need to remove?

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BeeHive {
  private ArrayList<Bee> beeList;

  public BeeHive(int numBees) {
    this.beeList = new ArrayList<Bee>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numBees; i++) {
      this.beeList.add(new Bee("bee" + i));
    }
  }

  public ArrayList<Bee> getBeeList() {
    return this.beeList;
  }

  public void moveOutBees() {


  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BeeHive myHive = new BeeHive(365);
    myHive.moveOutBees();

    // Print out the elements in the bee list to make sure the new bees were removed
    for(Bee b : myHive.beeList){
      System.out.println(b.getName());
    }
  }
}
```

Solution

Let's take a look at one solution for this challenge.

```
public void moveOutBees() {  for (int i = 0; i < this.beeList.size(); i++) {    this.beeList.remove(i);  }}
```

This one looks surprisingly simple, but there are some subtleties to it. Because we’re looking to remove every other Bee, we can just call `remove()` in our loop. It looks like this will remove every Bee, but it will actually remove every other Bee. A Bee will be removed, all other Bees will be shifted to the left, and then `i` increments by 1. The combination of Bees shifting and incrementing the counter means that a Bee will be skipped, resulting in every other Bee getting removed.

### 5\. Strike

Coding question

## Questions

Our bees are going on strike, and they demand new names! Given an `ArrayList` of `newNames` in `.renameBees()`, update each bee’s name to a name in the ArrayList at the corresponding index.

For example, say we have the following names: {“jamie”, “alex”, “jeremy”}. The bee should index 0 should get the name “jamie”. The second bee should get the name “alex” and the third bee should get the name “jeremy”.

If there are not enough names for every bee in the `beeList`, then you don’t have to update the names for the remaining bees. (We can talk to them to work out a compromise).

Hint

Since we want to match up the bees in the `beeList` to a name in `newNames`, we can iterate through both of the `ArrayLists` simultaneously.

Hint

You can update a bee’s name using its `.setName()` method.

Hint

Let’s think about what some possible scenarios

1.  There are more names than bees.
2.  There are more bees than names.
3.  There are the same number of bees as names.

For each of these scenarios, what checks can we make in our loop to make sure we don’t try to access elements outside of the `ArrayLists`?

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BeeHive {
  private ArrayList<Bee> beeList;

  public BeeHive(int numBees) {
    this.beeList = new ArrayList<Bee>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numBees; i++) {
      this.beeList.add(new Bee("bee" + i));
    }
  }

  public ArrayList<Bee> getBeeList() {
    return this.beeList;
  }

  public void renameBees(ArrayList<String> newNames) {


  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BeeHive myHive = new BeeHive(3);
    ArrayList<String> newNames = new ArrayList<String>();
    newNames.add("bob");
    newNames.add("macey");
    newNames.add("anna");

    myHive.renameBees(newNames);

    // Print out the elements in the bee list to make sure the new bees were added
    for (Bee b : myHive.beeList) {
      System.out.println(b.getName());
    }
  }
}
```

Solution

Let's take a look at one solution for this challenge.

```
public void renameBees(ArrayList<String> newNames) {  int numNamesToAssign = this.beeList.size();  if (newNames.size() < this.beeList.size()) {    numNamesToAssign = newNames.size();  }  for (int i = 0; i < numNamesToAssign; i++) {    this.beeList.get(i).setName(newNames.get(i));  }}
```

The key to this problem is knowing what our limits are. There are two `ArrayList`s that we want to traverse, but the length of both cannot be guaranteed. What we do know is that we only want to traverse as far as the shortest list.

If there are more names than bees, then we don’t need to traverse through all the names available. We can simply stop when all the bees’ names are updated.

If there are more bees than names, then we should only traverse through all the names available.

If there are the same number of bees as there are names, then we can traverse through all of the names and bees.

This means that before we do any traversing, we want to set the terminating condition for our `for` loop to be whatever the smallest `ArrayList` is. Then, we can iterate through both lists like normal, and use `.get()` to access the elements at the counter variable without worrying about an `IndexOutOfBounds` error. From here, we can update each `Bee`‘s name using `.setName()`.
