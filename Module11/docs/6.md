# Java Code Challenge: Traversing 2D Arrays

Test your knowledge of 2D array traversal with these code challenges!

2D arrays allow us to create and store data within rows and columns. Using iteration, we can traverse through these values to gather information about the data. In this activity, we’ll focus on traversing 2D arrays to gather information about a set of data.

Four wildlife researchers in Victoria, Australia spent five days counting the number of koalas they came across in different areas. Their numbers were as follows:

-   | Noor | Edward | Camila | Amir — | — | — | — | — Day 1 | 17 | 13 | 19 | 22 Day 2 | 12 | 18 | 25 | 20  
    Day 3 | 15 | 18 | 21 | 24 Day 4 | 19 | 23 | 23 | 22 Day 5 | 18 | 20 | 21 | 26

The researchers want to use this chart to gather some information regarding their trip using Java. This type of data would be very fitting for a 2D array.

Multiple choice

## Questions

Which of the following options depicts the data above as a Java 2D array called `koalaSpottings`?

## Answer Choices

(Selected)Correct:

`int[][] koalaSpottings = {{17, 13, 19, 22}, {12, 18, 25, 20}, {15, 18, 21, 24}, {19, 23, 23, 22}, {18, 20, 21, 26}};`

None of the options depict the data as a 2D array.

`int[][] koalaSpottings = {17, 13, 19, 22, 12, 18, 25, 20, 15, 18, 21, 24, 19, 23, 23, 22, 18, 20, 21, 26};`

`int[] koalaSpottings = {{17, 13, 19, 22}, {12, 18, 25, 20}, {15, 18, 21, 24}, {19, 23, 23, 22}, {18, 20, 21, 26}};`

👏

Correct! This options shows the data above when placed in a 2D array.

### Traversing a 1D Array

A lot of the standard algorithms used for 1D arrays can be carried over when traversing a 2D array. Let’s pretend we only got the data from the first day of observation. We can place this data in a 1D array that looks like this:

```
int[] dayOne = {17, 13, 19, 22};
```

With this, let’s try to find the total number of koalas spotted on the first day. To do this, we’ll do the following:

1.  Create an `int` variable and set it to `0`. This will be used to store the cumulative sum of each element value.
2.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the array.
3.  Inside the loop, increase the variable created in step 1 by the current element value.
4.  Return the variable storing the sum.

Coding question

## Questions

Complete the function `getTotal()` which takes in an array of `int`s as a parameter and returns the sum of each element value of the array.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
class KoalaCounting {
  public static int getTotal(int[] arr) {
    // Add your code below
    int total = 0;
    for (int i= 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        total += arr[i];
    }
    return total;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] dayOne = {17, 13, 19, 22};
    System.out.println(getTotal(dayOne));
  }
}

Let’s go over this solution:

```
public static int getTotal(int[] arr) {    int total = 0;    for (int i= 0; i < arr.length; i++) {        total += arr[i];    }    return total;}
```

First, we created a variable called `total` and set its value to `0`. This variable will store the cumulative sum of our array’s values. Next, we created a `for` loop that iterates from `0` to one value less than the length of our array. Inside the array, we only have one instruction: `total += arr[i]`. This line increases the current value of `total` by the value of the element at index `i`. Outside our loop, we return the value of `total`.

### Finding the Sum of a 2D Array

Now, let’s go ahead and iterate through the 2D array to find out the total amount of koalas spotted over the five days. The code will look similar to the last example with some slight adjustments.

1.  Create an `int` variable and set it to `0`. This will be used to store the cumulative sum of each element value.
2.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the rows of the 2D array.
3.  Create a nested loop to iterate through the columns of the 2D array.
4.  Inside the loop, increase the variable created in step 1 by the current element value.
5.  Return the variable storing the sum.

Coding question

## Questions

Complete the function, `getTotal()`, which takes in a 2D array and returns the overall sum value of every single element.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
class KoalaCounting {
  public static int getTotal(int[][] arr2D) {
    // Add your code below
    int total = 0;
    for (int row = 0; row < arr2D.length; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < arr2D[0].length; col++) {
            total += arr2D[row][col];
        }
    }
    return total;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[][] koalaSpottings = {{17, 13, 19, 22}, {12, 18, 25, 20}, {15, 18, 21, 24}, {19, 23, 23, 22}, {18, 20, 21, 26}};
    System.out.println(getTotal(koalaSpottings));
  }
}
```

Let’s go over how we accomplished this:

```
public static int getTotal(int[][] arr2D) {    int total = 0;    for (int row = 0; row < arr2D.length; row++) {        for (int col = 0; col < arr2D[0].length; col++) {            total += arr2D[row][col];        }    }    return total;}
```

Similarly to the last challenge, we start by creating an `int` variable, `total`, set to `0`. Next, we have to iterate through each value in the 2D array. This involves accessing each row of the 2D array and then every element, or column, inside the inner array. First, we create a `for` loop that starts at `0` and iterates until the iteration is one less than the length of the 2D array. This will allow us to access each of the 2D array’s rows. Inside our `for` loop, we make a second, nested `for` loop. This will also start it’s iteration at `0`. However, the iteration will end when its value is one less than the length of one of the inner arrays: `col < arr2D[0].length`. Inside the nested loop, our only task will be to increase `total` by the current element value. To do this, we will use the code `total += arr2D[row][col]`. This line inside the nested loops allows us to grab every single element value of our 2D array. Finally, outside the loops, we return `total`.

### Searching for a Value in a 2D array

Instead of grabbing every element in an array, what if we only wanted to find and use specific values? The researchers want to know the number of times they spotted more than 20 koalas in a day. To find out with Java, we’d need to take these steps:

1.  Create a counter variable.
2.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through the rows of the 2D array.
3.  Create a nested loop to iterate through the columns of the 2D array.
4.  Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the element value is greater than 20. If the condition is true, increase the counter variable by 1.
5.  Return the counter variable.

Coding question

## Questions

Finish the method `findValuesGreaterThan()` which takes in two parameters: a 2D array of `int` values and an `int` value, `num`. The method returns the number of elements in the 2D array that are greater than `num`.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
class KoalaCounting {
  public static int findValuesGreaterThan(int[][] arr2D, int num) {
    // Add your code below
    int total = 0;
    for (int row = 0; row < arr2D.length; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < arr2D[0].length; col++) {
            if (arr2D[row][col] > num) {
                total += 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return total;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[][] koalaSpottings = {{17, 13, 19, 22}, {12, 18, 25, 20}, {15, 18, 21, 24}, {19, 23, 23, 22}, {18, 20, 21, 26}};
    System.out.println(findValuesGreaterThan(koalaSpottings, 20));
  }

You got it!

Let’s go over the following solution:

```
public static int findValuesGreaterThan(int[][] arr2D, int num) {    int total = 0;    for (int row = 0; row < arr2D.length; row++) {        for (int col = 0; col < arr2D[0].length; col++) {            if (arr2D[row][col] > num) {                total += 1;            }        }    }    return total;}
```

A lot of this code is similar to what we’ve seen previously. We start by creating a counter variable, `total`. In order to search for a value in a 2D array, we must access each individual row of the 2D array. We start with creating a nested `for` loop; the outer loop iterates over each row while the inner loop iterates over each individual value of the arrays. Inside our nested loop, we use an `if` statement to check for the condition `arr2D[row][col] > num`. This condition is `true` when the current element value is larger than the value of the parameter `num`. If the condition is `true`, we increase `total` by `1`. Outside the loops, we return `total`.

### Finding the Column with the Largest Value

The researchers want to know which person spotted the most koalas over the five days. To find this information, we’ll have to iterate through a specific index of an array at each row. The steps for completing this task is:

1.  Create a variable, `largestColumn`, that will store the index value of the column with the largest sum.
2.  Create a variable, `largestSum` that will store the sum value of the column with the largest sum.
3.  Create a `for` loop that iterates through the columns of the 2D array. 4.Create a variable, `columnVal`, that will store the sum of an individual column.
4.  Create a nested `for` loop that iterates through the rows the 2D array.
5.  Inside the nested loop, increase the value of the variable `columnVal`, by the current element value.
6.  Outside the nested loop, but inside the outer loop, check if `columnVal` is larger than `largestSum`. If it is, set `largestSum` to `columnVal` and set `largestColumn` to the loop’s current iteration value.
7.  Outside the loop, return `largestColumn`.

Coding question

## Questions

Complete the method `largestColumn()`. The function accepts a 2D array of `int`s as a parameter and returns an `int` representing which column had the highest sum value.

### Code

CodeOutput

```java
class KoalaCounting {
  public static int largestColumn(int[][] arr2D) {
    // Add your code below
    int largestColumn = 0;
    int largestNumber = 0;
    for (int col = 0; col < arr2D[0].length; col++){
    int columnVal = 0;
        for (int row = 0; row < arr2D.length; row++) {
            columnVal += arr2D[row][col];
        }
        if (columnVal > largestNumber) {
            largestNumber = columnVal;
            largestColumn = col;
        }
    }
    return largestColumn;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[][] koalaSpottings = {{17, 13, 19, 22}, {12, 18, 25, 20}, {15, 18, 21, 24}, {19, 23, 23, 22}, {18, 20, 21, 26}};
    System.out.println(largestColumn(koalaSpottings));
  }

You got it!

Let’s go over this solution:

```
public static int largestColumn(int[][] arr2D) {    int largestColumn = 0;    int largestNumber = 0;    for (int col = 0; col < arr2D[0].length; col++){    int columnVal = 0;        for (int row = 0; row < arr2D.length; row++) {            columnVal += arr2D[row][col];        }        if (columnVal > largestNumber) {            largestNumber = columnVal;            largestColumn = col;        }    }    return largestColumn;}
```

We started by initializing two `int` variables with a value of `0`: `largestColumn` and `largestNumber`. `largestColumn` will be used to represent which column has the largest sum value while `largestNumber` represents said sum. Next we create a `for` loop. Unlike the previous code challenges, our outer `for` loop will be used to iterate through the columns. Therefore, we continue iterating until the value is one less than the length of an array row. Inside this loop, we create an `int` variable, `columnVal`, and set it to `0`. We’ll use this to temporarily store the sum of a column. After, we’ll create a nested loop that iterates through the rows of the 2D array. Inside the loop, we’ll add the current element value to `columnVal` with the line `columnVal += arr2D[row][col];`. Outside the nested loop but inside the outer loop, we use a conditional statement to check if `columnVal` is larger than `largestNumber`; if it is, we set `largestNumber` to equal `columnVal` and `largestColumn` to `col`.

If you’re still feeling confused, let’s look back at the chart. This time, we’ll add which index each researcher is represented by in the 2D array:

-   | Noor - 0th | Edward - 1st | Camila - 2nd | Amir - 3rd — | — | — | — | — Day 1 | 17 | 13 | 19 | 22 Day 2 | 12 | 18 | 25 | 20  
    Day 3 | 15 | 18 | 21 | 24 Day 4 | 19 | 23 | 23 | 22 Day 5 | 18 | 20 | 21 | 26

In the first iteration of the outer loop, we iterate through each element at the 0th index and add that value to `columnVal`. Think of this as getting the sum for the first column of numbers under Noor. This value looks like `17` + `12` + `15` + `19` + `18`, making `columnVal` equal `81`. We then check if `columnVal` has a value that is greater than the value of `largestNumber` which is currently `0`. Since the `columnVal` is larger, we set `largestNumber` to equal `columnVal` which is `87`. We then declare `largestColumn` to `0` to represent that the sum of all the values at the 0th index has the largest sum. This concludes the first iteration of the outer loop. Our process repeats now for each value at the 1st index. The sum of the 1st index (each value under the name of Edward) is `92`. When we compare `columnVal` (with a value of `92`) to `largestVal` (with a value of `87`), we see that the condition `columnVal > largestVal` is `true`; therefor, we change `largestVal` to represent the new largest value, `92`, and set `largestColumn` to `1`. This process repeats for index 2 and index 3. In the end, index 3 (under Amir) has the largest value; therefore, the method will return the value of `3`.

## Conclusion

Great job reaching the end of this article. Using Java 2D arrays and iteration, we were able to gather a lot of information for the koala researchers. Let’s go over what we learned:

-   The algorithms used on 1D arrays can also be applied to 2D arrays.
-   In order to access each element of a 2D array, we must iterate through each row of the array. Then, within the individual array, we need to iterate through each element.
    -   We were able to do this using nested `for` loops.
