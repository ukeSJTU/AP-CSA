# Welcome to Java Code Challenges

Let’s take a look at what’s coming up with code challenges.

This section of content is rather unique. Rather than introducing new topics, we’re going to spend some time using all of the tools we currently have to solve some code challenges. These challenges are similar to the types of problems you might see on the AP exam — you’re given a problem and need to use your programming knowledge to solve it! You’ll have to use your knowledge of variables, conditionals, classes, Arrays, ArrayLists, and loops.

Some of these problems are difficult! Give it your best shot, but don’t be afraid to look at our solution after trying these problems yourself a few times. If you do this, make sure to take the time to look at our solution and experiment with it to get a sense of what the code is doing.

Good luck!
