. To begin, let’s take a quick refresher on static methods.

Static methods are methods that belong to an entire class, not a specific object of the class. Static methods are called using the class name and the `.` operator. We’ve seen a couple of static methods already!

```
double randomNumber = Math.random();// Stores a random decimal between 0.0 and 1.0 in randomNumberdouble number = Double.valueOf("2.5");// Transforms the String "2.5" into a double
```

In the first example, `random()` is a static

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

that belongs to the `Math` class. We didn’t need to create a `Math` object (like `Math myMathObject = new Math()`) in order to use that method. We could just call it using the class name.

Similarly, `valueOf()` is a static method of the `Double` class. Given a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[`String`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

as an input, this method will turn that `String` into a `double`. Again, we don’t need to create a `Double` object in order to call this method — we use the class itself to call it.

Finally, notice that our `main()` methods have been `static` this whole time. When Java runs your program, it calls that the main method of your class — `YourClassName.main()`.

Instructions

We’ve set up some code with a handful of common static methods. We’re using:

-   [Math.random()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random--)
-   [Math.abs()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#abs-int-)
-   [Integer.toString()](<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#toString(int)>)

Take a look at the documentation for these methods and try to figure out what they do.

You can also look at the [documentation for the entire Math class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html) which has many more static methods. Find a static method that looks interesting to you, and try to use it!

### Static Variables

14 min

We’ll begin writing our own static methods soon, but before we do, let’s take a look at static

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

. Much like static methods, you can think of _static variables_ as belonging to the class itself instead of belonging to a particular object of the class.

Just like with static methods, we can access static variables by using the name of the class and the `.` operator. Finally, we declare static variables by using the `static` keyword during declaration. This keyword usually comes after the variable’s access modifier (`public` or `private`).

When we put this all together, we might end up with a class that looks something like this:

```
public class Dog{  // Static variables  public static String genus = "Canis";  //Instance variables  public int age;  public String name;  public Dog(int inputAge, String inputName){    this.age = inputAge;    this.name = inputName;  }}
```

Since all dogs share the same genus, we could use a static variable to store that information for the entire class. However, we want each dog to have its own unique `name` and `age`, so those aren’t `static`. We could now access this static variable in a `main()` function like so:

```
public class Dog{  //Variables, constructors and methods defined here  public static void main(String[] args){    System.out.println(Dog.genus); // Prints Canis  }}
```

Unlike static methods, you can still access static variables from a specific object of the class. However, no matter what object you use to access the variable, the value will always be the same. You can think of it as all objects of the class sharing the same variable

```
public static void main(String[] args){  Dog snoopy = new Dog(3, "Snoopy");  Dog ringo = new Dog(5, "Ringo");  System.out.println(Dog.genus); // Prints Canis  System.out.println(snoopy.genus); // Prints Canis  System.out.println(ringo.genus); // Prints Canis}
```

Finally, you might have seen a few static variables before. If you want easy access to the largest possible integer, you can get it by using `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. If you look at the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE) you’ll see that this variable is `public`, `static`, _and_ `final`. (`final` means that you can’t change the variable’s value after creating it.) We’re starting to know a lot of Java keywords!

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    We’re going to be building out an ATM class that has both static and non-static variables. We’ve started by giving you an ATM class with non-static variables, a constructor, and some methods. In the `main()` method, use the constructor to create two `ATM`s named `firstATM` and `secondATM`. Use the constructor so the first `ATM` has `1000` dollars in it and the second has `500`.

    If you’d like, you could print out each `ATM`‘s `money` variable to confirm you created them successfully.

    Hint

    You can use the constructor to create an `ATM` with `50` dollars in it like so:

    ```
    ATM myATM = new ATM(50);
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Let’s create two static variables.

    First, we want to create a variable to keep track of how much money is in the system across all `ATM`s. This should be a `public static int` variable and should be named `totalMoney`. This variable should begin with a value of `0`.

    Second, we want to know how many `ATM`s there are in the system. Again, this should be a `public static int` variable that has an initial value of `0`. Name this variable `numATMs`.

    Hint

    Create these two variables where you would create your instance variables. The first should be `public static int totalMoney = 0;`.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Let’s take a look at the first of these static variables. In the `main()` method, print your `totalMoney` variable three different times. The first time, you should use `ATM.totalMoney`, the second time you should use `firstATM.totalMoney`, and the third time you should use `secondATM.totalMoney`. Do you expect these print statements to be the same or different?

    Right now the value stored in `totalMoney` doesn’t actually represent the total amount of money stored in all ATMs. In the next exercise, we’ll look into how to change the value of static variables.

    Hint

    You should see the same value printed each time. Every ATM object shares the same `totalMoney` variable.

### Modifying Static Variables

8 min

Now that we’ve created a couple of static

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

, let’s start to edit them. The good news is that editing static variables is similar to editing any other variable. Whether you’re writing code in a constructor, a non-static

Preview: Docs A method is a small piece of code, usually defined in a class, that can be used outside the class and in other parts of the program.

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

, or a static method, you have access to static variables.

Before we jump into the checkpoints, let’s think about times when you might want to edit static variables. Often times, you’ll see static variables used to keep track of information about all objects of a class. For example, our variable `numATMs` is keeping track of the total number of `ATM`s in the system. Therefore, every time an `ATM` is created (using the constructor), we should increase that variable by `1`. If we could somehow destroy an `ATM`, the method that destroys it should decrease `numATMs` static variable by `1`.

Similarly, we have a variable named `totalMoney`. This variable is keeping track of all money across all ATMs. Whenever we remove money from an ATM using the non-static `withdrawMoney()` method, we should modify the `money` instance variable for that particular ATM as well as the `totalMoney` variable. In doing so, all ATMs will know how much money is in the system.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Edit the constructor to increase `numATMs` by `1` every time an `ATM` is created. In the main method, we’re printing out `numATMs` before and after creating some `ATM`s. You should expect to see that number go up as you create `ATM`s.

    Hint

    In the constructor, you’ll want to add `numATMs += 1;`

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Edit the constructor so when a new `ATM` is created, the amount of money that `ATM` starts with gets added to the static variable `totalMoney`.

    Hint

    You’ll want to add `inputMoney` to `totalMoney`.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Edit the `withdrawMoney()` method so when money is taken out of a specific `ATM`, the static variable `totalMoney` also reflects that change.

    Take a look at the `main()` method — we’re printing `totalMoney` before and after withdrawing money from a couple of `ATM`s.

    Hint

    Right after `this.money -= amountToWithdraw;`, write `totalMoney -= amountToWithdraw;`.

### Writing Your Own Static Methods

Nice work! Now that we’ve seen how static

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

work, let’s look into how to write our own static methods.

Let’s get the syntax out of the way first — just like with variables, to create a static

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

, use the `static` keyword in the method’s definition. Just like with variables, this keyword usually comes after `public` or `private`.

```
public static void myFirstStaticMethod(){  // Some code here}
```

Often times, you’ll see static methods that are accessors or mutators for static variables.

```
public static int getMyStaticVariable(){  return myStaticVariable;}public static void setMyStaticVariable(int newValue){  myStaticVariable = newValue;}
```

One important rule to note is that static methods can’t interact with non-static instance variables.

To wrap your mind around this, consider why we use `this` when working with non-static instance variables. Let’s say we have a `Dog` class with a non-static instance variable named `age`. If we have a line of code like `this.age = 5;`, that means we’re setting the `age` of a specific `Dog` equal to `5`. However, if `age` were static, that would mean that the variable belongs to the entire class, not a specific object.

The `this` keyword can’t be used by a static method since static methods are associated with an entire class, not a specific object of that class. If you try to mix `this` with a static method, you’ll see the error message `non-static variable this cannot be referenced from a static context`.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Let’s write a static method that prints the average amount of money in all vending machines in the system.

    The method name should be `averageMoney` and it should be `void` since it doesn’t return anything. The method should print `totalMoney` divided by `numATMs`. Note that both of those variables are static.

    After writing the method, call the method at the end of the `main()` method. Recall that since this is a static method, you’ll use the name of the class to call the method, not an object of the class.

    Hint

    Your method signature should be `public static void averageMoney()`. When calling the method, use `ATM.averageMoney()`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Let’s try to have `averageMoney()` interact with a non-static instance variable. In `averageMoney()`, try to print `this.money`. You should expect to see an error message — a static method can’t interact with a non-static instance variable.

    Hint

    You should see `non-static variable this cannot be referenced from a static context`.

Static Variables and Methods

### Review

<1 min

Great work! You now have an understanding of what the `static` keyword does. In fact, if you’ve made it this far in your Java lessons, you probably have a pretty good sense of what all the keywords and jargon are doing in `public static void main(String[] args)`. Take a moment to celebrate — that line of code can be incredibly intimidating for new learners and it’s a real accomplishment to learn about all of those different pieces.

To review, here are some of the main takeaways about static methods and variables:

-   Static methods and

    Preview: Docs Loading link description

    [variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

    are associated with the class as a whole, not objects of the class.

-   Static methods and variables are declared as static by using the `static` keyword upon declaration.
-   Static methods cannot interact with non-static instance variables. This is due to static methods not having a `this` reference.
-   Both static methods and non-static methods can interact with static variables.

Instructions

We’ve given you the complete code for your ATM class. Feel free to experiment with these static variables and methods. In particular, you might want to create a few more `ATM`s in the `main()` method and see how the static variables change. You could also consider writing a `depositMoney()` method that works in the opposite way as `withdrawMoney()`.
