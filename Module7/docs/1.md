# Access, Encapsulation, and Scope

## What are Access and Scope?

As Java programs grow larger and involve multiple objects and classes interacting with each other, the concepts of _access_ and _scope_ become crucial. These concepts revolve around which parts of your program can interact with specific variables or methods from other parts of your program. Here's a brief overview of what we'll cover:

### Access

-   The `public` and `private` keywords and their relation to classes, variables, constructors, and methods
-   The concept of encapsulation
-   Accessor methods, sometimes known as "getters"
-   Mutator methods, sometimes known as "setters"

### Scope

-   Local variables vs. instance variables
-   The `this` keyword

Let's get started!

### Exercise: Understanding Access Errors

Look at the two files provided: **Bank.java** and **CheckingAccount.java**. Notice that the instance fields in **CheckingAccount.java** are declared using the `private` keyword.

When you run **Bank.java**, you encounter two errors because the `main()` method in **Bank.java** attempts to access the `private` instance fields of the `CheckingAccount` class. The code in question is:

```java
public class Bank {
  private CheckingAccount accountOne;
  private CheckingAccount accountTwo;

  public Bank() {
    accountOne = new CheckingAccount("Zeus", 100);
    accountTwo = new CheckingAccount("Hades", 200);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bank bank = new Bank();
    System.out.println(bank.accountOne.name);
    System.out.println(bank.accountOne.balance);
  }
}
```

```java
public class CheckingAccount {
  private String name;
  private int balance;

  public CheckingAccount(String inputName, int inputBalance) {
    name = inputName;
    balance = inputBalance;
  }
}
```

**Output (Error):**

```plaintext
Bank.java:13: error: name has private access in CheckingAccount
System.out.println(bank.accountOne.name);
^
Bank.java:14: error: balance has private access in CheckingAccount
System.out.println(bank.accountOne.balance);
^
2 errors
```

Try to identify which variables are causing the errors.

## The `public` Keyword

After running the code in the previous exercise, you should develop an intuition about what the `public` and `private` keywords do. These keywords define which parts of your code have _access_ to other parts of your code.

We can define the access of various components like instance variables, methods, constructors, and even a class itself. Declaring something as `public` means any part of our code can interact with it, even if that code is in a different class.

Here's how we declare something as `public` using the keyword in the declaration statement. In the code block below, notice the five different uses of `public`:

```java
public class Dog {
  public String name;
  public int age;
  public Dog(String input_name, int input_age) {
    name = input_name;
    age = input_age;
  }
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("Arf Arf! My name is " + name + " and I am a good dog!");
  }
}
```

Since everything about a `Dog` is public, any other class can access anything about a `Dog`. For example, a `DogSchool` class could make a new `Dog` using the `public` `Dog` constructor, directly access that `Dog`'s instance variables, and use that `Dog`'s methods:

```java
public class DogSchool {
  public void makeADog() {
    Dog cujo = new Dog("Cujo", 7);
    System.out.println(cujo.age);
    cujo.speak();
  }
}
```

Note that the `DogSchool` class and the `makeADog()` method are also public. This means that if another class created a `DogSchool`, they would have access to these methods as well. We have public methods calling public methods!

For the purposes of this lesson, we'll almost always make our classes and constructors `public`. While you can set them to `private`, it's fairly uncommon. Instead, we'll focus on why you might make instance variables and methods `private`.

### Exercise: Changing Access Modifiers

1. Inside the **CheckingAccount.java** file, observe the declared methods and variables.
2. Open the **Bank.java** file and run it to note the errors that appear. Make sure you have the **Bank.java** file open (not **CheckingAccount.java**) when you click "Run".
3. We are getting errors because inside `main()` of **Bank.java**, we are trying to access the `name` instance field of `CheckingAccount`, which is declared as `private`. To fix the problem, change the access modifier of the `name` field so that it may be accessed from outside the `CheckingAccount` class.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class Bank {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CheckingAccount accountOne = new CheckingAccount("Zeus", 100, "1");
    CheckingAccount accountTwo = new CheckingAccount("Hades", 200, "2");
    System.out.println(accountOne.name);
    accountOne.addFunds(5);
    accountOne.getInfo();
  }
}
```

```java
public class CheckingAccount {
  public String name; // Changed from private to public
  private int balance;
  private String id;

  public CheckingAccount(String inputName, int inputBalance, String inputId) {
    name = inputName;
    balance = inputBalance;
    id = inputId;
  }

  public void addFunds(int fundsToAdd) {
    balance += fundsToAdd;
  }

  public void getInfo() {
    System.out.println("This checking account belongs to " + name + ". It has " + balance + " dollars in it.");
  }
}
```

**Output after Modification:**

```plaintext
Zeus
This checking account belongs to Zeus. It has 105 dollars in it.
```

## The `private` Keyword and Encapsulation

By now, you're probably understanding what the `private` keyword does. When a class's instance variable or method is marked as `private`, it can only be accessed from within that same class. Let's revisit our `DogSchool` example:

```java
public class DogSchool {
  public void makeADog() {
    Dog cujo = new Dog("Cujo", 7);
    System.out.println(cujo.age);
    cujo.speak();
  }
}
```

`makeADog` is trying to directly access `Dog`'s `.age` variable and use the `.speak()` method. If those are marked as `private` in the `Dog` class, the `DogSchool` class won't be able to do that. Other methods within the `Dog` class could use `.age` or `.speak()`, but other classes won't have access.

### Why Use `private`?

You might wonder why bother with any of this. In the last exercise, the code was broken until some variables and methods were flipped to `public`. Why not just make everything `public`?

While that's a valid point, restricting code access can be useful from a design perspective. This is a core idea behind _encapsulation_. By making instance variables (and some methods) `private`, we encapsulate our code into neat bundles of logic.

For example, a `Bank` object doesn't need to know the inner workings of a `CheckingAccount` object. It doesn't need to know that money is stored in a field named `money`, or that interest is added using a method named `.addInterest()`. If it had access to those fields or methods, someone using a `Bank` object could unintentionally change things in a `CheckingAccount`. By limiting access with the `private` keyword, we can segment our code into individual units.

Note that we don't want to completely block everything from other classes. In the next section, we'll explore when you might want to make methods public by looking at getter and setter methods.

### Exercise: Accessing Private Fields

1. In the `main()` of the **Bank.java** file, create a new instance of `CheckingAccount` called `myAccount`. Pass in initial values of `"Mike"` for the name and `300` for the initial balance.
2. Inside the `CheckingAccount` class, write a method called `printBalance()` that will print out the balance of the `CheckingAccount`. The method should print: `"Account balance is <balance>"` where `<balance>` is the value of `balance`.
3. In the `main()` method of **Bank.java**, use the `printBalance()` method to print out the balance of `myAccount`.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class Bank {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CheckingAccount accountOne = new CheckingAccount("Zeus", 100);
    CheckingAccount accountTwo = new CheckingAccount("Hades", 200);
    CheckingAccount myAccount = new CheckingAccount("Mike", 300);
    myAccount.printBalance();
  }
}
```

```java
public class CheckingAccount {
  private String name;
  private int balance;

  public CheckingAccount(String inputName, int inputBalance) {
    name = inputName;
    balance = inputBalance;
  }

  private void addFunds(int fundsToAdd) {
    balance += fundsToAdd;
  }

  private void getInfo() {
    System.out.println("This checking account belongs to " + name + ". It has " + balance + " dollars in it.");
  }

  public void printBalance() {
    System.out.println("Account balance is " + balance);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Account balance is 300
```

## Accessor and Mutator Methods

When writing classes, we often make all instance variables `private`. However, we might still want other classes to access them without knowing the exact variable name. To provide access to a private instance variable, we write an _accessor method_ (sometimes known as a "getter" method).

```java
public class Dog {
  private String name;
  // Other methods and constructors
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
}
```

Even though the instance variable `name` is `private`, other classes can call the `public` method `getName()` to return the value of that instance variable. Accessor methods are always `public` and have a return type matching the type of the instance variable they're accessing.

Similarly, `private` instance variables often have mutator methods (sometimes known as "setters"). These methods allow other classes to reset the value stored in `private` instance variables.

```java
public class Dog {
  private String name;
  // Other methods and constructors
  public void setName(String newName) {
    name = newName;
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog myDog = new Dog("Cujo");
    myDog.setName("Lassie");
  }
}
```

Mutator methods, or "setters", are often `void` methods—they don't return anything, they just reset the value of an existing variable. They typically have one parameter of the same type as the variable they're changing.

### Exercise: Implementing Getters and Setters

1. Inside `CheckingAccount`, write an accessor method for the `balance` instance field called `getBalance()`. This method should be accessible from other classes. Inside `main()` of **Bank.java**, use `getBalance()` to print out the balance of `accountOne`.
2. Inside the `CheckingAccount` class, write a mutator method called `setBalance()` to change the value of the `balance` field.
3. Inside `main()` of **Bank.java**, use `setBalance()` to set `accountOne`'s balance to `5000`.
4. Print the new balance of `accountOne` using `getBalance()`.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class Bank {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CheckingAccount accountOne = new CheckingAccount("Zeus", 100, "1");
    CheckingAccount accountTwo = new CheckingAccount("Hades", 200, "2");
    System.out.println(accountOne.getBalance());
    accountOne.setBalance(5000);
    System.out.println(accountOne.getBalance());
  }
}
```

```java
public class CheckingAccount {
  public String name;
  private int balance;
  private String id;

  public CheckingAccount(String inputName, int inputBalance, String inputId) {
    name = inputName;
    balance = inputBalance;
    id = inputId;
  }

  public int getBalance() {
    return balance;
  }

  public void setBalance(int newBalance) {
    balance = newBalance;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
100
5000
```

## Scope: Local Variables

In addition to access modifiers like `public` and `private`, the _scope_ of a variable determines what parts of your code can access that variable. The scope is determined by where the variable is declared. For instance, because instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any methods or constructors, all methods and constructors are within the scope of that variable.

```java
class Dog {
  public String name;
  public int age;
  public int weight;
  public Dog() {
    name = "Winston";
    age = 8;
    weight = 30;
  }
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("My name is " + name);
  }
}
```

However, if a variable is declared inside a method, it can only be used within that method. The same applies to parameters—their scope is limited to the method they're associated with. These are often called local variables. Note that we don't use `public` or `private` when declaring local variables.

This concept of scope extends to conditionals and loops as well. If you declare a variable inside the body of a conditional or loop, that variable can only be used within that structure. This includes the looping variable in a `for` loop. For example:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // You can use i here
}
// i is out of scope here
```

You can only use `i` between the curly braces of the `for` loop. In general, whenever you see curly braces, be aware of scope. If a variable is defined inside curly braces and you try to use it outside, you will likely encounter an error.

### Exercise: Understanding Variable Scope

1. Inside `main()`, an array called `myArray` is declared with some elements. We're looping through the values and trying to store the sum in a variable called `int sum`. Notice that the `sum` variable is declared inside the `for` loop. Run the code to see an error related to the scope of the `sum` variable.
2. We get an error because the `sum` variable only exists within the scope of the `for` loop. To make the `sum` variable accessible within the scope of the `main()` method, move the declaration of the `sum` variable above the `for` loop. Run the code again.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class ScopeExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
      sum += myArray[i];
    }
    System.out.println(sum);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
10
```

## Scope: The `this` Keyword

Often, when creating classes, programmers will create local variables with the same name as instance variables. For example:

```java
public class Dog {
  public String name;
  public Dog(String inputName) {
    name = inputName;
  }
  public void speakNewName(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, my new name is " + name);
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog myDog = new Dog("Winston");
    myDog.speakNewName("Darla"); // Prints "Darla" - "Winston" ignored
  }
}
```

We have an instance variable named `name`, but the method `speakNewName` has a parameter named `name`. When the method tries to print `name`, which variable will be printed? By default, Java refers to the local variable name. So, the value passed to the parameter will be printed, not the instance variable.

If we want to access the instance variable instead of the local variable, we use the `this` keyword:

```java
public class Dog {
  public String name;
  public Dog(String inputName) {
    name = inputName;
  }
  public void speakNewName(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, my new name is " + this.name);
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog a = new Dog("Fido");
    Dog b = new Dog("Odie");
    a.speakNewName("Winston"); // "Fido", the instance variable of Dog a is printed
    b.speakNewName("Darla"); // "Odie", the instance variable of Dog b is printed
  }
}
```

The `this` keyword is a reference to the current object. We used `this.name` in our `speakNewName()` method, causing it to print the value stored in the instance variable `name` of whatever `Dog` object called `speakNewName()`.

Oftentimes, constructors have parameters with the same name as the instance variable. For example:

```java
public Dog(String name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```

You can read this as "set this `Dog`'s instance variable `name` equal to the variable passed into the constructor". While this naming is common, it can be confusing. There's nothing wrong with naming parameters differently for clarity:

```java
public Dog(String inputName) {
  this.name = inputName;
}
```

Mutator methods also usually follow this pattern:

```java
public void setName(String name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```

Throughout the rest of this lesson, we'll use `this.` when referring to an instance variable. This isn't always necessary—if there's no local variable with the same name, Java will use the instance variable. However, it's a good habit to use `this.` to avoid potential confusion.

### Exercise: Using `this` in Constructors and Methods

1. Inside the empty constructor for the `SavingsAccount` class, set the instance variables `owner`, `balanceDollar`, and `balanceEuro` to the local variables. For `balanceEuro`, set it equal to `balanceDollar` multiplied by `0.85` (assuming every dollar is worth 0.85 euros).
2. Inside `SavingsAccount`, create a method called `addMoney()` that accepts a parameter called `balanceDollar` and increases the value of the field `balanceDollar` by the local variable.
3. Add a print statement before adding the money to print: `"Adding <amountToAdd> dollars to the account."` and after adding the money: `"The new balance is <currentBalance> dollars."`
4. Inside `main()` of the **Main.java** file, add `2000` dollars to `zeusSavingsAccount` by calling the `addMoney()` method.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SavingsAccount zeusSavingsAccount = new SavingsAccount("Zeus", 1000);
    zeusSavingsAccount.addMoney(2000);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Adding 2000 dollars to the account.
The new balance is 3000.0 dollars.
```

## Using `this` With Methods

We've seen how `this` works with variables, but we can also use it with methods. Recall how we've been calling methods up to this point:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Dog myDog = new Dog("Odie");
  myDog.speak();
}
```

Here, we're creating an instance of a `Dog` and using that `Dog` to call the `speak()` method. However, when defining methods, we can also use the `this` keyword to call other methods:

```java
public class Computer {
  public int brightness;
  public int volume;
  public void setBrightness(int inputBrightness) {
    this.brightness = inputBrightness;
  }
  public void setVolume(int inputVolume) {
    this.volume = inputVolume;
  }
  public void resetSettings() {
    this.setBrightness(0);
    this.setVolume(0);
  }
}
```

Look at the `resetSettings()` method. This method calls other methods from the class but needs an object to call those methods. Rather than creating a new object, we use `this` as the object. This means the object that calls `resetSettings()` will be used to call `setBrightness(0)` and `setVolume(0)`.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Computer myComputer = new Computer();
  myComputer.resetSettings();
}
```

In this example, calling `myComputer.resetSettings()` is equivalent to calling `myComputer.setBrightness(0)` and `myComputer.setVolume(0)`. `this` serves as a placeholder for whatever object was used to call the original method.

Finally, `this` can be used as a value for a parameter. If a method takes a `Computer` as a parameter (e.g., `public void pairWithOtherComputer(Computer other)`), you can use `this` as the parameter when calling that method from another method in `Computer`:

```java
public void pairWithOtherComputer(Computer other) {
  // Code for method that uses the parameter other
}
public void setUpConnection() {
  // We use "this" to call the method and also pass "this" to the method
  this.pairWithOtherComputer(this);
}
```

### Exercise: Using `this` to Call Methods

1. Look at the `Person` class with three instance fields: `age`, `wisdom`, and `fitness`. Each has its mutator method declared. Run the code to observe.
2. Inside the empty `hasBirthday()` method, use the mutator methods to increase `age` by `1`, increase `wisdom` by `5`, and decrease `fitness` by `3`.
3. Switch to **Main.java**. An instance of `Person` named `emily` is created. Run the code to see the output.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person emily = new Person(20);
    emily.hasBirthday();
    System.out.println("New age is: " + emily.age);
    System.out.println("New wisdom is: " + emily.wisdom);
    System.out.println("New fitness is: " + emily.fitness);
  }
}
```

```java
public class Person {
  public int age;
  public int wisdom;
  public int fitness;

  public Person(int inputAge) {
    this.age = inputAge;
    this.wisdom = inputAge * 5;
    this.fitness = 100 - inputAge;
  }

  public void setAge(int newAge) {
    this.age = newAge;
  }

  public void setWisdom(int newWisdom) {
    this.wisdom = newWisdom;
  }

  public void setFitness(int newFitness) {
    this.fitness = newFitness;
  }

  public void hasBirthday() {
    this.setAge(this.age + 1);
    this.setWisdom(this.wisdom + 5);
    this.setFitness(this.fitness - 3);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
New age is: 21
New wisdom is: 105
New fitness is: 77
```

## Other Private Methods

Now that we've seen how methods can call other methods using `this.`, let's look at a situation where you might want to use `private` methods. Often, `private` methods are helper methods—methods that other, larger methods use.

For our `CheckingAccount` example, we might want a public method like `getAccountInformation()` that prints information such as the account owner's name, the amount of money in the account, and the interest for the next month. Another class, like a `Bank`, could call this public method to get all that information quickly.

To get that information, we might break the larger method into several helper methods. For instance, inside `getAccountInformation()`, we might call a function called `calculateNextMonthInterest()`. That helper method should probably be `private`. There's no need for a `Bank` to call these smaller helper methods directly—instead, a `Bank` can call the one `public` method and rely on it to do the complicated work by calling smaller `private` methods.

### Exercise: Implementing Private Helper Methods

1. Inside the `getAccountInformation()` method of the `CheckingAccount` class, we call `calculateNextMonthInterest()`, which we haven't declared yet. Create a method called `calculateNextMonthInterest()` that returns a `double`. This method should not be accessible from outside the `CheckingAccount` class.
2. Inside `calculateNextMonthInterest()`, return next month's interest using the formula: `nextMonthInterest = balance * interestRate`.
3. Call the `getAccountInformation()` method on the `accountOne` instance. Run the code to see the final results.

**Code Example:**

```java
public class Bank {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CheckingAccount accountOne = new CheckingAccount("Zeus", 100, "1");
    accountOne.getAccountInformation();
  }
}
```

```java
public class CheckingAccount {
  private String name;
  private int balance;
  private String id;
  private double interestRate;

  public CheckingAccount(String inputName, int inputBalance, String inputId) {
    this.name = inputName;
    this.balance = inputBalance;
    this.id = inputId;
    this.interestRate = 0.02;
  }

  public void getAccountInformation() {
    System.out.println("Money in account: " + this.getBalance());
    System.out.println("Next Month's Interest: " + this.calculateNextMonthInterest());
  }

  private int getBalance() {
    return this.balance;
  }

  private double calculateNextMonthInterest() {
    return this.interestRate * this.balance;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Money in account: 100
Next Month's Interest: 2.0
```

## Review

In this lesson, we explored subtle features of classes with a focus on access, encapsulation, and scope. Here are the main takeaways:

-   The `public` and `private` keywords define what parts of code have access to other classes, methods, constructors, and instance variables.
-   Encapsulation is a technique used to keep implementation details hidden from other classes, aiming to create small bundles of logic.
-   The `this` keyword designates the difference between instance variables and local variables.
-   Local variables can only be used within the scope they were defined in.
-   The `this` keyword can be used to call methods when writing classes.

### Exercise: Experiment with Access Modifiers

In the provided code for **Bank.java** and **CheckingAccount.java**, experiment with the `private` and `public` keywords. Here are some ideas to try:

-   Create a method to close an account.
-   Add a method to apply fees or charges.
-   Introduce different currencies into the code.
