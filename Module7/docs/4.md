## Questions

Given the code block, which line(s) of code will successfully print the value `5`.

### Code

```
public class ATM{  public static int totalMoney = 0;    public ATM(){    totalMoney += 5;  }    public static void main(String[] args){    System.out.println(ATM.totalMoney); //Line 1        ATM myATM = new ATM();    System.out.println(ATM.totalMoney); //Line 2    System.out.println(myATM.totalMoney); //Line 3        ATM mySecondATM = new ATM();    System.out.println(ATM.totalMoney); //Line 4    System.out.println(myATM.totalMoney); //Line 5   }  }
```

## Answer Choices

-   Lines 2, 3, 4, and 5
-   Line 2
-   Lines 1, 2, and 3
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Lines 2 and 3

    👏

    Correct! You can access a static variable using either the class name or an object of the class (although we usually use the class name).

What is the mistake in the code block?

### Code

```
public class ATM{  public static int totalMoney = 0;    public int money;    public ATM(int money){    this.money = money;  }    public static int getMoney(){    return this.money;  }    public int getTotalMoney(){    return totalMoney;  }  }
```

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    The static method `getMoney()` is trying to access the non-static variable `money`.

    👏

    Correct! Remember, static methods have no `this` reference, and so they can’t access instance variables.

-   The non-static method `getTotalMoney()` is trying to access the static variable `totalMoney`.
-   The variable `totalMoney` can’t be given the value of `0` when it is declared.
-   The constructor is incorrectly setting the value of an instance variable due to incorrectly using a local variable.

Fill in the code so the value `5` will be printed.

### Code

```
public class MyDemoClass{    public static int variableA = 4;  public int variableB;    public MyDemoClass(){    variableA += 1;    this.variableB = 4;  }    public static void main(String[] args){        MyDemoClass myObject = new MyDemoClass();    System.out.println(MyDemoClass.variableA);  }  }
```

## Answer Choices

-   variableB
-   this

Click or drag and drop to fill in the blank

👏

You got it!

## Questions

What is the difference between declaring static variables and instance variables?

## Answer Choices

-   When declaring static variables, you use the `this` keyword along with the variable type.
-   When declaring static variables, you use keywords like `private` or `public` to make the variable static.
-   When declaring static variables, you use no keywords, but when declaring instance variables you use the `this` keyword
-   (Selected)Correct:

    When declaring static variables, you use the `static` keyword. For instance variables, you use the `this` keyword, or no keyword.

    👏

    Correct! You would declare a static variable like `public static int myVariable`.

## Questions

Why are static methods unable to interact with instance variables and non-static methods?

## Answer Choices

-   Static methods _can_ interact with non-static variables and methods. However, non-static methods can’t interact with static variables.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Static methods are associated with a class, not an object of the class. As a result, static methods have no `this` reference.

    👏

    Correct! You can’t ask for something like `this.variable` or `this.method()`.

-   Static methods are associated with an object, not the class itself. As a result, static methods have no `this` reference.
