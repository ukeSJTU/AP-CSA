## Questions

What does encapsulation mean?

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    The concept of separating methods and variables into distinct bundles of logic.

    👏

    Correct! We encapsulate our classes to help organize our code.

-   The concept of returning values from your methods.
-   The concept that some variables only exist in a certain scope.
-   The concept of creating different classes to represent objects in the real world.

## Questions

What value will be printed given the following code snippet?

### Code

```
public class Human(){  public String name;    public Human(String inputName){    this.name = inputName;  }    public void sayName(String name){    System.out.println("My name is " + name);  }    public static void main(String[] args){    Human hero = new Human("Clark Kent");    hero.sayName("Superman");  }}
```

## Answer Choices

-   `My name is Clark Kent`
-   Nothing will be printed since `sayName()` is a `void` method.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    `My name is Superman`

    👏

    Correct! In this case, since we’re not using `this.name`, the local variable `name` will be printed.

-   `My name is hero`

## Questions

Let’s say you’re writing a method named `increaseAgeByFive()` that is trying to increase the instance variable of the `Dog` class named `age` by `5`. However, there is also a local variable named `age`. How would you increase only the instance variable by `5`.

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    ```
    this.age += 5;
    ```

    👏

    Correct! By using `this.` we are modifying the instance variable named `age`.

-   ```
    age += 5;
    ```
-   ```
    Dog.age += 5;
    ```
-   ```
    self.age += 5;
    ```

## Questions

Explain the body of the `methodOne()` method in simple terms.

### Code

```
class myDemoClass(){    int demoInstanceVariable;    public void methodOne(){    this.methodTwo(this);  }    public void methodTwo(myDemoClass a){    System.out.println(a.demoInstanceVariable);  }  }
```

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Incorrect:

    The method will print the instance variable `demoInstanceVariable` of whatever `myDemoClass` object that it gets as a parameter.

    Not quite! This is a good explanation of the body of `methodTwo()`, not `methodOne()`.

-   Whatever object (`this`) that called `methodOne()` proceeds to call `methodTwo()`. `methodTwo()` takes a `myDemoClass` object as a parameter, so in addition to calling the method, `this` passes itself as a parameter to `methodTwo()`.

    Correct answer

-   Whatever object (`this`) that called `methodOne()` proceeds to call `methodTwo()`. `methodTwo()` has a default parameter of `this` which will automatically be whatever object called `methodOne`.
-   Look, Codecademy, we’re using that weird `this` keyword twice, and that’s really confusing. I can’t explain what that’s doing.

## Questions

Which of the following is NOT true about mutator methods.

## Answer Choices

-   Mutator methods are often `void` methods.
-   Mutator methods should be marked as `public`.
-   Mutator methods often have one parameter of the same type as the instance variable they’re interacting with.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Mutator methods return the value of an instance variable.

    👏

    Correct! This is the job of an accessor method.

## Questions

Given the following instance variables for a `Dog` class, which of the following methods is an accessor method for the `age` variable?

### Code

```
public class Dog{  private String name;  private int age;  }
```

## Answer Choices

-   ```
    private int getAge(){  return this.age;}
    ```
-   ```
    private String getAge(){  return this.age;}
    ```
-   ```
    public String getAge(){  return this.age;}
    ```
-   (Selected)Correct:

    ```
    public int getAge(){  return this.age;}
    ```

    👏

    Correct! An accessor method should be `public` and return the correct instance variable.
