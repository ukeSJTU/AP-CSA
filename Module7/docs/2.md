# Quiz: Access, Encapsulation, and Scope

## Question 1: Access Modifiers

Fill in the code so the `String` instance variable named `name` is accessible from other classes, but the `int` variable named `age` isn't.

**Code:**

```java
public class Student {
  public String name;
  private int age;
}
```

## Question 2: Encapsulation Definition

What does encapsulation mean?

-   **Correct Answer:** The concept of separating methods and variables into distinct bundles of logic.

    -   Explanation: We encapsulate our classes to help organize our code.

-   **Other Choices:**
    -   The concept of returning values from your methods.
    -   The concept that some variables only exist in a certain scope.
    -   The concept of creating different classes to represent objects in the real world.

## Question 3: Local vs. Instance Variables

What value will be printed given the following code snippet?

**Code:**

```java
public class Human {
  public String name;
  public Human(String inputName) {
    this.name = inputName;
  }
  public void sayName(String name) {
    System.out.println("My name is " + name);
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Human hero = new Human("Clark Kent");
    hero.sayName("Superman");
  }
}
```

-   **Correct Answer:** `My name is Superman`

    -   Explanation: Since we're not using `this.name`, the local variable `name` will be printed.

-   **Other Choices:**
    -   `My name is Clark Kent`
    -   Nothing will be printed since `sayName()` is a `void` method.
    -   `My name is hero`

## Question 4: Using `this` Keyword

Let's say you're writing a method named `increaseAgeByFive()` that is trying to increase the instance variable of the `Dog` class named `age` by `5`. However, there is also a local variable named `age`. How would you increase only the instance variable by `5`?

-   **Correct Answer:**

    ```java
    this.age += 5;
    ```

    -   Explanation: By using `this.`, we are modifying the instance variable named `age`.

-   **Other Choices:**
    -   `age += 5;`
    -   `Dog.age += 5;`
    -   `self.age += 5;`

## Question 5: Understanding `this` in Method Calls

Explain the body of the `methodOne()` method in simple terms.

**Code:**

```java
class myDemoClass {
  int demoInstanceVariable;
  public void methodOne() {
    this.methodTwo(this);
  }
  public void methodTwo(myDemoClass a) {
    System.out.println(a.demoInstanceVariable);
  }
}
```

-   **Correct Answer:** Whatever object (`this`) that called `methodOne()` proceeds to call `methodTwo()`. `methodTwo()` takes a `myDemoClass` object as a parameter, so in addition to calling the method, `this` passes itself as a parameter to `methodTwo()`.

    -   Explanation: This describes the behavior of `methodOne()`, where `this` is used both to call `methodTwo()` and to pass the current object as a parameter.

-   **Other Choices:**
    -   The method will print the instance variable `demoInstanceVariable` of whatever `myDemoClass` object that it gets as a parameter.
    -   Whatever object (`this`) that called `methodOne()` proceeds to call `methodTwo()`. `methodTwo()` has a default parameter of `this` which will automatically be whatever object called `methodOne`.
    -   Look, we’re using that weird `this` keyword twice, and that’s really confusing. I can’t explain what that’s doing.

## Question 6: Mutator Methods

Which of the following is NOT true about mutator methods?

-   **Correct Answer:** Mutator methods return the value of an instance variable.

    -   Explanation: This is the job of an accessor method, not a mutator method.

-   **Other Choices:**
    -   Mutator methods are often `void` methods.
    -   Mutator methods should be marked as `public`.
    -   Mutator methods often have one parameter of the same type as the instance variable they’re interacting with.

## Question 7: Accessor Methods

Given the following instance variables for a `Dog` class, which of the following methods is an accessor method for the `age` variable?

**Code:**

```java
public class Dog {
  private String name;
  private int age;
}
```

-   **Correct Answer:**

    ```java
    public int getAge() {
      return this.age;
    }
    ```

    -   Explanation: An accessor method should be `public` and return the correct instance variable with the matching return type.

-   **Other Choices:**
    -   `private int getAge() { return this.age; }`
    -   `private String getAge() { return this.age; }`
    -   `public String getAge() { return this.age; }`
