## Questions

Which is NOT a facet of polymorphism in Java?

## Answer Choices

-   A Java child class can override its parent’s methods.
    
-   A Java class can inherit fields and methods from another class.
    
    Correct answer
    
-   (Selected)Incorrect:
    
    It’s possible to use objects of different classes that share a parent class together in an array or `ArrayList`.
    
    This is a part of polymorphism. Inheriting fields and methods is not polymorphism.
    
-   You can use a child class object like a member of its parent class.
