for calculating the area, and another method for displaying the shape. But what happens if we want a class for a triangle that has some triangle-specific methods? Do we need to redefine all of the same methods that we created for `Shape`?

No! (Phew.) Lucky for us, a Java class can also _inherit_ traits from another class. Because a `Triangle` is a `Shape`, we can define `Triangle` so that it inherits fields and methods directly from `Shape`. A reference of type `Shape` can refer to an object of `Shape` or an object of `Triangle`. The object-oriented principle of inheritance saves us the headache of redefining the same class members all over again.

Our `Triangle` class will inherit all the traits of `Shape`, but `Triangle` can also contain its own unique methods and

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

. For example, we could have an instance variable called `hypotenuse` and a method called `findHypotenuse()` that can only be accessed by `Triangle` class references. Objects of `Triangle` can call any method contained in `Triangle` or `Shape`. This gives us a bunch of possibilities!

There are several terms you’ll encounter frequently:

-   _Parent class_, _superclass_, and _base class_ refer to the class that another class inherits from (like `Shape`).
-   _Child class_, _subclass_, and _derived class_ refer to a class that inherits from another class (like `Triangle`).

So how do we define a child class so that it inherits from a parent class? We use the keyword `extends` like this:

```
class Shape {  // Shape class members}class Triangle extends Shape {  // additional Triangle class members}
```

Now `Triangle` has inherited traits from `Shape`, meaning it copied over class members from `Shape`. When we use

[inheritance](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/inheritance)

to extend a subclass from a superclass, we create an “is-a” relationship from the subclass to the superclass. For example, an object of `Triangle` _is a_ member of the `Shape` class; however, an object of `Shape` is not necessarily an object of `Triangle`.

Until now, we’ve only been working with one class and one file. However, most Java programs utilize multiple classes, each of which requires its own file. Only one file needs a `main()`

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

— this is the file we will run.

Note: the various classes in our Java package — even though they are in different files — will have access to each other, so we can instantiate one class inside of another.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed
    
    1.
    
    We’ve provided two files:
    
    -   **Noodle.java**: This will be our parent class.
        
    -   **Spaghetti.java**: This will be our child class.
        
    
    Notice that the parent class **Noodle.java** already has some instance fields and methods:
    
    -   The `lengthInCentimeters` field.
        
    -   The `shape` field.
        
    -   The `texture` field.
        
    -   A `cook()` method.
        
    
    Let’s create a child class. In the **Spaghetti.java** file, create a class called `Spaghetti` and make it a child class of the `Noodle` class.
    
    Run the **Noodle.java** file.
    
    Hint
    
    In the following example, we create a class called `Earth` which is a child class of the class called `Planet`:
    
    ```
    class Earth extends Planet { }
    ```
    
2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed
    
    2.
    
    Inside `main()` of **Main.java**, create a new instance of the `Spaghetti` class and name it `spaghettiPomodoro`.
    
    Print out the `texture` field of the instance `spaghettiPomodoro` to the terminal.
    
    Hint
    
    For example, to instantiate an object of class `Flower` called `daisy`, we would do it like so:
    
    ```
    Flower daisy = new Flower(); 
    ```
    
    To print it’s `color` field, we would access it like this:
    
    ```
    System.out.println(daisy.color); 
    ```

Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Inheriting the Constructor

10 min

Hang on, you might be thinking, if the child class inherits its parent’s fields and methods, does it also inherit the constructor? Let’s take a look at how the `super()` constructor works!

Let’s say `Shape` has a `numSides` field that is set by passing an integer into the constructor. If we’re instantiating a `Triangle`, we would want that number to always be `3`, so we’d want to modify the constructor to automatically assign `numSides` with a value of `3`.

Can we do that?

As it happens, Java has a trick up its sleeve for just this occasion: using the `super()`

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

which acts like the parent constructor inside the child class constructor:

```
class Triangle extends Shape {  Triangle() {    super(3);  }  // additional Triangle class members}
```

By passing `3` to `super()`, we are making it possible to instantiate a `Triangle` without passing in a value for `numSides`.

Meanwhile, `super(3)` (behaving as `Shape(3)`) will shoulder the responsibility of setting `numSides` to `3` for our `Triangle` object. It’s like we called `Shape(3)`.

It is also possible to write a constructor without making a call to any `super()` constructor:

```
class Triangle extends Shape {  Triangle() {    this.numSides = 3;  }  // additional Triangle class methods}
```

In this situation, Java secretly calls the parent class’ no-argument constructor (`super()`). So in this specific example, the `Triangle()` constructor first calls the `Shape()` constructor. That `Shape()` takes care of whatever business it needs to take care of. And then after that is complete, we go in and set `this.numSides` to `3`.

If you’re writing a constructor of a child class, and don’t explicitly make a call to a constructor from a parent class using `super`, it’s important to remember that Java will automatically (and secretly) call `super()` as the first line of your child class constructor.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed
    
    1.
    
    Let’s use the constructor of the parent class of the `Pho` class.
    
    Inside the constructor `Pho()`, use `super()` to access the constructor of the `Noodle` class and pass in these arguments in the following order:
    
    -   `30.0` as the value of `lengthInCentimeters`
    -   `0.64` as `widthInCentimeters`
    -   “flat” as the `shape`
    -   “rice flour” as the `ingredients`
    
    Hint
    
    Here we use `super()` inside the constructor `FavFlowers()` to access the constructor of the `Flower` class. We pass these values to `super()`:
    
    -   “red” as the `color`
    -   3 as the `flowersCount`
    
    ```
    FavFlowers() {   super("red", 3); } 
    ```
    
2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed
    
    2.
    
    Inside `main()` of **Main.java**, create a new object of the `Pho` class called `phoChay`.
    
    Hint
    
    We can access the `color` field of the `daisy` instance like so:
    
    ```
    daisy.color; 
    ```
    
3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed
    
    3.
    
    Now print out the `phoChay` instance’s `shape` field.
    
    Hint
    
    We use the following line to print things in Java:
    
    ```
    System.out.println("Some String");
    ```

Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Parent Class Aspect Modifiers

8 min

You may recall that Java class members use `private` and `public` access modifiers to determine whether they can be accessed from outside the class. So does a child class inherit its parent’s `private` members?

Well, no. But there is another access modifier we can use to keep a parent class member accessible to its child classes and to files in the package it’s contained in — and otherwise private: `protected`. ![public is visible everywhere; protected is visible in the class, the package, and child classes; a member with no modifier is visible in the class and package; private is visible only in the class itself](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/access-modifiers-chart.png) Here’s what `protected` looks like in use:

```
class Shape {  protected double perimeter;}// any child class of Shape can access perimeter
```

In addition to access modifiers, there’s another way to establish how child classes can interact with inherited parent class members: using the `final` keyword. If we add `final` after a parent class method’s access modifier, we disallow any child classes from changing that

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

. This is helpful in limiting bugs that might occur from modifying a particular method.

Though it is not required, there is an established order when two or more field modifiers are used (eg. `public final`). To learn more about this read the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.3.1).

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed
    
    1.
    
    For now, all the instance fields of the `Noodle` class are `private` so the child class `Ramen` won’t be able to access them.
    
    Inside **Noodle.java**, Change the access modifiers of the `ingredients` and `texture` fields so that only the child classes can access them.
    
    Hint
    
    We use the access modifier called `protected` so that only the child classes can use them:
    
    ```
    protected String color; 
    ```
    
2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed
    
    2.
    
    The `Noodle` class has an `isTasty()` method that returns `true` because noodles are tasty. But if we check in the `Ramen` class, we can see someone overrode the `isTasty()` method to return `false`! That person clearly doesn’t know about good food: all noodles are tasty.
    
    Remove the `isTasty()` method from `Ramen` and add a `final` keyword to `isTasty()` in the `Noodle` class so that nobody can change this method in any other `Noodle` child class again.
    
    Switch over to the **Main.java** file to run the code.
    
    Hint
    
    We use the `final` keyword after the modifier like so:
    
    ```
    public final String displayInstructions() {     } 
    ```

principle of

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[_polymorphism_](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/polymorphism)

. Polymorphism, which derives from Greek meaning “many forms”, allows a child class to share the information and behavior of its parent class while also incorporating its own functionality.

The main advantages of polymorphic programming:

-   Simplifying syntax
-   Reducing cognitive overload for developers

These benefits are particularly helpful when we want to develop our own Java packages for other developers to import and use.

For example, the built-in operator `+` can be used for both `double`s and `int`s. To the computer, the `+` means something like `addDouble()` for one and `addInt()` for the other, but the creators of Java (and of other languages) didn’t want to burden us as developers with recalling each individual

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

.

Note that the reverse situation is not true; you cannot use a generic parent class instance where a child class instance is required. So an `Orange` can be used as a `Fruit`, but a `Fruit` cannot be used as an `Orange`.

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

slightly different meanings for different classes. This is useful when we want our child class method to have the same name as a parent class method but behave a bit differently in some way.

Let’s say we have a `BankAccount` class that allows us to print the current balance. We want to build a `CheckingAccount` class that inherits the functionality of a `BankAccount` but with a modified `printBalance()` method. We can do the following:

```
class BankAccount {  protected double balance;  public BankAccount(double balanceIn){    balance = balanceIn;  }  public void printBalance() {    System.out.println("Your account balance is $" + balance);  }}class CheckingAccount extends BankAccount {    public CheckingAccount(double balance) {    super(balance);  }  @Override  public void printBalance() {    System.out.println("Your checking account balance is $" + balance);  }}
```

Notice that in order to properly override `printBalance()`, in `CheckingAccount` the method has the following in common with the corresponding method in `BankAccount`:

-   Method name
-   Return type
-   Number and type of parameters

You may have also noticed the `@Override` keyword above `printBalance()` in `CheckingAccount`. This annotation informs the compiler that we want to override a method in the parent class. If the method doesn’t exist in the parent class, we’ll get a helpful error when we compile the program.

**Keep Reading: AP Computer Science A Students**

In a previous exercise, we learned that the `super` keyword can be used to call the constructor of a superclass. That’s not the only use of `super`; we can also use this keyword to call the methods of a parent class. While we now have the ability to override methods from a superclass, we may find ourselves in a unique situation where we want to use the superclass method instead of the subclass’ overridden method.

If that’s the case, we can call the parent class method by prepending `super` followed by the dot operator (`.`) to the method call. Note that this only works if we pass in the proper method parameters. Let’s see this in action by adding a `checkBalances()` method to `CheckingAccount` that calls both versions of `printBalance()`:

```
class CheckingAccount extends BankAccount {  public CheckingAccount(double balance) {    super(balance);  }  @Override  public void printBalance() {    System.out.println("Your checking account balance is $" + balance);  }  public void checkBalances() {    // calls method from CheckingAccount    printBalance();    // calls method from BankAccount    super.printBalance();  }  public static void main(String[] args) {    CheckingAccount myCheckings = new CheckingAccount(5000);    myCheckings.checkBalances();  }}
```

This program will output:

```
Your checking account balance is $5000Your account balance is $5000
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed
    
    1.
    
    Inside the `Noodle` class, we have a `cook()` method that prints “Boiling.” and changes the `texture` to “cooked”.
    
    The `Noodle` class has a child class called [spätzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle) which is a German noodle that follows a different cooking procedure than the normal noodle: grinding or scraping the dough into the pot of boiling water.
    
    Override the inherited `cook()` method so we can use it to cook the spätzle too.
    
    In the `cook()` method print the following string “Grinding or scraping the dough into the pot of boiling water.” and set the `texture` to “cooked”.
    
    Remember to add `@Override` above the method.
    
    Hint
    
    To override a method, we need to define the method with the same name, return type, and parameters in the child class. Here, we override the `bark()` method:
    
    ```
    @Override public void bark() { } 
    ```
    
    Notice, we’ve used the `@Override` annotation above the method.

Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Using a Child Class as its Parent Class

10 min

An important facet of

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/polymorphism)

is the ability to use a child class object where an object of its parent class is expected.

One way to do this explicitly is to instantiate a child class object as a member of the parent class. We can instantiate a `CheckingAccount` object as a `BankAccount` like this:

```
BankAccount kaylasAccount = new CheckingAccount(600.00);
```

We can use `kaylasAccount` as if it were an instance of `BankAccount`, in any situation where a `BankAccount` object would be expected. (This would be true even if `kaylasAccount` were instantiated as a `CheckingAccount`, but using the explicit child as parent syntax is most helpful when we want to declare objects in bulk.)

It is important to note here that the compiler just considers `kaylasAccount` to be any old `BankAccount`. But because

overriding is handled at

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[runtime](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/runtime)

, if we call `printBalance()`, we’ll see something `CheckingAccount` specific:

```
Your checking account balance is $600.00
```

This is because at runtime, `kaylasAccount` is recognized as the `CheckingAccount` it is. So, what if `CheckingAccount` has a method `transferToSavings()` that `BankAccount` does not have? Can `kaylasAccount` still use that method?

Well, no. The compiler believes that `kaylasAccount` is just a `BankAccount` that doesn’t have some fancy child class `transferToSavings()` method, so it would throw an error.

    1.
    
    Look at the `Dinner` class where we have a `makeNoodles()` method that accepts a `Noodle` object and a `String` as an argument. 看看 `Dinner` 类,我们有一个 `makeNoodles()` 方法,它接受一个 `Noodle` 对象和一个 `String` 作为参数。
    
    We have an instance of the `Dinner` class called `noodlesDinner` defined in the `main()` method.
    
    Inside `main()` of the **Main.java** file, instantiate `BiangBiang` as a `Noodle` called `biangBiang`.
    
    Remember to use the child class as an instance of its parent class.
    
    Hint
    
    In the following example, we instantiate `Rectangle`as a `Shape` called `rectangle`:
    
    ```
    Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(); 
    ```
    
2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed
    
    2.
    
    Call the `makeNoodles()` method on the `noodlesDinner` instance and pass these arguments:
    
    -   `biangBiang`
    -   `"soy sauce and chili oil"`
    
    Hint
    
    Here we call the `makeNoodles()` on the `lunch` instance and pass these values:
    
    -   `newInstance`
    -   `"chili oil"`
    
    ```
    lunch.makeNoodles(newInstance, "chili oil"); 
    ```

Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Child Classes in Arrays and ArrayLists

9 min

Usually, when we create an

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

or an `ArrayList`, the list items all need to be the same type. But

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/polymorphism)

puts a new spin on what is considered the same type…

In fact, we can put instances of different classes that share a parent class together in an array or `ArrayList`! For example, let’s say we have a `Monster` parent class with a few child classes: `Vampire`, `Werewolf`, and `Zombie`. We can set up an array with instances of each:

```
Monster dracula, wolfman, zombie1;dracula = new Vampire();wolfman = new Werewolf();zombie1 = new Zombie();Monster[] monsters = {dracula, wolfman, zombie1};
```

We can even iterate through the list of items — regardless of subclass — and perform the same action with each item:

```
for (Monster monster : monsters) {  monster.attack();}
```

In the code above, we were able to call `attack()` on each monster in `monsters` despite the fact that, in the for-each loop, `monster` is declared as the parent class type `Monster`.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed
    
    1.
    
    Look at the code editor. We have `Noodle` as a parent class and it has three child classes: `Pho`, `Ramen`, and`Spaghetti`.
    
    Inside the `main()` method of **Main.java**, declare an array of type `Noodle` called `allTheNoodles` and initialize it with the following items: `spaghetti`, `ramen`, `pho` in that order.
    
    Hint
    
    If we must declare and initialize an array of type `Drink`, we would do it like so:
    
    ```
    Drink[] drink= {tea, coffee}; 
    ```
    
2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed
    
    2.
    
    Use the `for-each` loop to traverse through each noodle in `allTheNoodles`.
    
    Inside the `for-each` loop, call the `getCookPrep()` method on each noodle and print the result.
    
    > Note: you must use a `for-each` loop and not a regular `for` loop for this exercise!
    
    Hint
    
    Here we use the `for` loop to traverse through each monster in `monsters` and call the `attack()` method. We’ll print the returned result:
    
    ```
    for (Monster monster : monsters) {   System.out.println(monster.attack()); } 
    ```

### Child Classes in Method Parameters

When we call a

that contains parameters, the arguments we place in our method call must match the

Preview: Docs A parameter is the name of a variable passed into a function. Parameters allow functions to accept inputs. An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value of the variable (also known as the parameter) passed into a function. Suppose we have a function called tripleThis(): js function tripleThis(x) { return x \* 3; } tripleThis(6);

[parameter](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/parameter)

type. Similar to the previous exercise,

Preview: Docs Polymorphism is one of the four principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It promotes dynamic inheritance of child classes from their parent class in order to make use of these features themselves in code. With polymorphism, child classes are able to inherit methods from their parent class for use. This ability to inherit functionality from parent classes not only speeds up the development process, but also helps us reason and understand our code more intuitively as we can see the correlation between objects for easier understanding and manipulation of source code. py from math import pi class Shape: def init(self, name): self.name = name

[polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/polymorphism)

gives us a little more flexibility with the arguments we can use.

If we use a superclass reference as a method parameter, we can call the method using subclass reference arguments!

For example, imagine the class `ScaryStory`, whose constructor takes in a reference to the `Monster` class:

```
class ScaryStory {  Monster monster;  String setting;  public ScaryStory(Monster antagonist, String place) {    monster = antagonist;    setting = place;  }  public void tellStory(){    System.out.println("Once upon a time, " + monster.name + " was at " + setting + " looking to scare some mortals.");  }  public static void main(String[] args) {    Monster dracula;    dracula = new Vampire("Dracula");    ScaryStory countDracula = new ScaryStory(dracula, "Dracula Castle");    countDracula.tellStory();  }}
```

In the `main()` method, we used a reference of the class `Vampire` as our

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[argument](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/argument)

even though the constructor requested an object of class `Monster`. This is allowed because `Vampire` is a subclass of the `Monster` class.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed
    
    1.
    
    Look at the new file called **Main.java**. There is an instance of `NoodleRestaurant` called `customer1`. The class `NoodleRestaurant` has a method called `order()` that takes in an object of type `Noodle` as a parameter.
    
    We instantiated `Ramen` and `Pho` as `Noodle` in the `main()` method.
    
    Inside the `main()` method, call the `order()` method of the `customer1` instance and pass in the `pho` instance as an argument.
    
    Hint
    
    The `Pho` class is a child class of the `Noodle` class so we can pass its instances as an argument for the `order()` method.
    
    `pho` is an instance of the `Pho` class.
    
    Here is how we can call a method of an instance:
    
    ```
    someInstance.someMethod(someParameter);
    ```

and

[polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/programming-paradigms/polymorphism)

in Java:

-   A Java class can inherit fields and methods from another class.
-   Each Java class requires its own file, but only one class in a Java package needs a `main()`
    
    Preview: Docs Loading link description
    
    [method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)
    
    .
-   Child classes inherit the parent constructor by default, but it’s possible to modify the constructor using `super()` or override it completely.
-   You can use `protected` and `final` to control child class access to parent class members.
-   Java’s OOP principle of polymorphism means you can use a child class object like a member of its parent class, but also give it its own traits.
-   You can override parent class methods in the child class, ideally using the `@Override` keyword.
-   It’s possible to use objects of different classes that share a parent class together in an
