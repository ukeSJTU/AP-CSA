# Project: Planting a Tree

## Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

## Goal

Introduce yourself to users and plant a tree for them using console output.

## Project Structure

-   **PlantingATree_Starter/**: Contains the starter template with TODO comments for students to complete.
-   **PlantingATree_Solution/**: Contains the completed solution for reference.

## Tasks

1. **Creating the Class**: Define a class named `Tree` following Java naming conventions.
2. **Defining the `main()` Method**: Add a `main()` method inside the class to execute program tasks.
3. **Adding Comments**: Write a comment in `main()` describing the task (introduce yourself and print a tree).
4. **Introduction Message**: Print a message introducing yourself (e.g., "Hey there, I’m [YourName] and I’m learning to code in Java!").
5. **Project Goal Message**: Print a message about the project goal (e.g., "Ready to get my hands dirty!").
6. **Planting Trees**: Use multiple `System.out.println()` statements to create a tree structure in the console using ASCII art.
7. **Experimentation**: Have fun experimenting with different tree designs.
