Print Line

```
System.out.println("Hello, world!");// Output: Hello, world!
```

`System.out.println()` can print to the console:

-   `System` is a class from the core library provided by Java
-   `out` is an object that controls the output
-   `println()` is a method associated with that object that receives a single argument

Comments

```
// I am a single line comment!/*And I am a multi-line comment!*/
```

Comments are bits of text that are ignored by the compiler. They are used to increase the readability of a program.

-   Single line comments are created by using `//`.
-   Multi-line comments are created by starting with `/*` and ending with `*/`.

Statements

```
System.out.println("Java Programming ☕️");
```

In Java, a statement is a line of code that executes a task and is terminated with a `;`.

Compiling Java

```
# Compile the class file:javac hello.java# Execute the compiled file:java hello
```

In Java, when we compile a program, each individual class is converted into a **.class** file, which is known as byte code.

The JVM (Java virtual machine) is used to run the byte code.

Classes

```
public class Person {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println("I am a person, not a computer.");      }  }
```

A _class_ represents a single concept.

A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program filename.

In the example, the `Person` class must be declared in a program file named **Person.java**.
