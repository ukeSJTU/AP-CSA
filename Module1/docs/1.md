Hello World

### Introduction to Java

3 min

Welcome to the world of Java programming!

Programming languages enable humans to write instructions that a computer can perform. With precise instructions, computers coordinate applications and systems that run the modern world.

[Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) released the Java programming language in 1995. Java is known for being simple, portable, secure, and robust. Though it was released over twenty years ago, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages today.

One reason people love Java is the Java Virtual Machine, which ensures the same Java code can be run on different operating systems and platforms. Sun Microsystems’ slogan for Java was “write once, run everywhere”.

![Java Virtual Machine running Java on three different platforms](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/Java%20Module%201-%20Lesson%201-JVM%20-ART%20408.png)

Programming languages are composed of _syntax_, the specific instructions which Java understands. We write syntax in

to create _programs_, which are executed by the computer to perform the desired task.

Let’s start with the universal greeting for a programming language. We’ll explore the syntax in the next exercise.

### Hello Java File!

7 min

Java runs on different platforms, but programmers write it the same way. Let’s explore some rules for writing Java.

In the last exercise, we saw the file `HelloWorld.java`. Java

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[files](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/files)

have a **.java** extension. Some programs are one file, others are hundreds of files!

Inside `HelloWorld.java`, we had a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[_class_](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/classes?page_ref=catalog)

:

```
public class HelloWorld {  }
```

We’ll talk about classes more in the future, but for now think of them as a **single** concept.

The `HelloWorld` concept is: Hello World Printer. Other class concepts could be: Bicycle, or: Savings Account.

We marked the domain of this concept using curly braces: `{}`. Syntax inside the curly braces is part of the class.

Each file has one primary class named after the file. Our class name: `HelloWorld` and our file name: **HelloWorld**. Every word is capitalized.

Inside the class we had a `main()` _method_ which lists our program tasks:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {}
```

Like classes, we used curly braces to mark the beginning and end of a method.

`public`, `static`, and `void` are syntax we’ll learn about in future lessons. `String[] args` is a placeholder for information we want to pass into our program. This syntax is necessary for the program to run but more advanced than we need to explore at the moment.

Our program also displayed the text `"Hello World"` on the screen. This was accomplished using a print statement:

```
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

We’ll learn more about print statements in the next exercise!

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    The text editor has a file, `HelloYou.java`, that contains a `HelloYou` class with a `main()` method.

    Inside `main()`, add a statement which prints `Hello someName!`, with **your** name replacing `someName`. Make sure to end the statement with a semicolon.

    For example, if your name were “Maria,” the program would print `Hello Maria!`.

    Hint

    Let’s say we want to print `Howdy World!`.

    Place that message **inside** double quotes: `"Howdy World!"`.

    Then place the quoted message inside the parentheses of `System.out.println()`.

    ```
    System.out.println("Howdy World!");
    ```

    The `println` has the letter `l` as in “laser”, not the number `1`.

    **You must use double quotes!**

### Print Statements

8 min

Let’s take a closer look at this instruction from our previous program:

```
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

Print statements output information to the screen (also referred to as the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[output](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/output?page_ref=catalog)

terminal). Let’s break this line of code down a little more. Don’t worry if some of the terms here are new to you. We’ll dive into what all of these are in much more detail later on!

-   `System` is a built-in Java class that contains useful tools for our programs.
-   `out` is short for “output”.
-   Preview: Docs Loading link description

    [`println`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/output/println?page_ref=catalog)

    is short for “print line”.

We can use `System.out.println()` whenever we want the program to create a new line on the screen after outputting a value:

```
System.out.println("Hello World");System.out.println("Today is a great day to code!");
```

After `"Hello World"` is printed, the output terminal creates a new line for the next statement to be outputted. This program will print each statement on a new line like so:

```
Hello WorldToday is a great day to code!
```

We also can output information using `System.out.print()`. Notice that we’re using `print()`, not `println()`. Unlike `System.out.println()`, this type of print statement outputs everything on the same line. For example:

```
System.out.print("Hello ");System.out.print("World");
```

The above code will have the following output:

```
Hello World
```

In this example, if you were to use `print()` or `println()` again, the new text will print immediately after `World` on the same line. It’s important to remember where you left your program’s “cursor”. If you use `println()` the cursor is moved to the next line. If you use `print()` the cursor stays on the same line.

**Note:** Going forward after this exercise, all exercises will use `System.out.println()` to output values. You will get to practice using `System.out.print()` statements in the Checkpoints below, however.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Enabled

    1.

    Inside `main()` and underneath the print statement `System.out.println("Let's play hide and seek.");`, output the following two statements using `System.out.print()`:

    -   `"Three..."`
    -   `"Two..."`

    Hint

    Be sure to use `System.out.print()`. Your code should look similar to the following example:

    ```
    System.out.print("First statement");System.out.print("Second statement");
    ```

    Make sure the text in your print statements matches the instructions exactly. Capitalization, punctuation, and spaces matter!

2.  Checkpoint 2 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed

    2.

    Underneath your previous statements, output the following two text values using `System.out.println()`:

    -   `"One..."`
    -   `"Ready or not, here I come!"`

### Commenting Code

5 min

Writing code is an exciting process of instructing the computer to complete fantastic tasks.

Code is also read by people, and we want our intentions to be clear to humans just like we want our instructions to be clear to the computer.

Fortunately, we’re not limited to writing syntax that performs a task. We can also write

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[_comments_](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/comments?page_ref=catalog)

, notes to human readers of our code. These comments are not executed, so there’s no need for valid syntax within a comment.

When comments are short we use the single-line syntax: `//`.

```
// calculate customer satisfaction rating
```

When comments are long we use the multi-line syntax: `/*` and `*/`.

```
/*We chose to store information across multiple databases tominimize the possibility of data loss. We'll need to be carefulto make sure it does not go out of sync!*/
```

Another type of commenting option is the Javadoc comment which is represented by `/**` and `*/`. Javadoc comments are used to create documentation for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). When writing Javadoc comments, remember that they will eventually be used in the documentation that your users might read, so make sure to be especially thoughtful when writing these comments.

Javadoc comments are typically written before the declaration of fields,

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[methods](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/methods)

, and

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[classes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/classes)

(which we’ll cover later in this course):

```
/*** The following class accomplishes the following task...*/
```

Here’s how a comment would look in a complete program:

```
/*** The following class shows what a comment would look like in a program.*/public class CommentExample {  // I'm a comment inside the class  public static void main(String[] args) {    // I'm a comment inside a method    System.out.println("This program has comments!");  }}
```

Comments are different from printing to the screen, when we use `System.out.println()`. These comments **won’t** show up in our terminal, they’re only for people who read our code in the text editor.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    The file `Timeline.java` has plain text information about Java.

    Plain text facts aren’t valid syntax. We’ll use comments to avoid breaking the program.

    Use the single-line comment syntax for the first fact.

    Change this line into a comment:

    `Sun Microsystems announced the release of Java in 1995`

    Hint

    We use the following syntax for a single-line comment: `//`.

    To change `A tale of sound and fury` into a comment, place `//` before the line:

    ```
    // A tale of sound and fury
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Our program is still broken!

    Use the **multi-line syntax** to make these lines into a **single** comment:

    ```
        James Gosling is a Canadian engineer who created Java while    working at Sun Microsystems. His favorite number is the    square root of 2!
    ```

    You should still see `You are a fun language!` printed!

    Hint

    Multi-line comments have an opening and closing syntax.

    Consider the text:

    ```
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
    ```

    We can make a comment from this text by surrounding it with `/*` and `*/`.

    ```
    /*Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.*/
    ```

# Hello World: Semicolons and Whitespace

## Narrative and Instructions

Learn

Hello World

### Semicolons and Whitespace

5 min

As we saw with

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[comments](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/comments)

, reading code is just as important as writing code.

We should write code that is easy for other people to read. Those people can be co-workers, friends, or even yourself!

Java does not interpret _whitespace_, the areas of the code without syntax, but humans use whitespace to read code without difficulty.

Functionally, these two code samples are identical:

```
System.out.println("Java");System.out.println("Lava");System.out.println("Guava");
```

```
System.out.println("Java");System.out.println("Lava");System.out.println("Guava");
```

They will print the same text to the screen, but which would you prefer to read? Imagine if it was hundreds of instructions! Whitespace would be essential.

Java **does** interpret semicolons. Semicolons are used to mark the end of a _statement_, one line of code that performs a single task.

The only statements we’ve seen so far are `System.out.println("My message!");`.

Let’s contrast statements with the curly brace, `{}`. Curly braces mark the scope of our

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[classes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/classes)

and

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[methods](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/methods)

. There are no semicolons at the end of a curly brace.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    The `LanguageFacts.java` file prints information about Java to the screen.

    Unfortunately, the writer of the file has avoided using whitespace.

    Make the file easier to read by adding a newline after each statement!

    Hint

    Enter a newline character by pressing return or enter.

    You should see all the code after your cursor move down by one line.

    ```
    // Before entering a newlineSystem.out.println("Feels");System.out.println("Cramped!");// Entering a newline after the first semicolonSystem.out.println("Feels");System.out.println("Cramped!");
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside `main()`, add a new statement printing how you feel about coding.

    Start the message with: “Programming is… “.

    **Remember to place a semicolon at the end of the statement!**

    Hint

    For this checkpoint, you can use the `System.out.println()` function to print your message about coding. Don’t forget to end your statement with a semicolon (`;`) to indicate the end of the statement.

# Hello World: Compilation: Catching Errors

## Narrative and Instructions

Hello World

### Compilation: Catching Errors

8 min

Java is a _compiled_ programming language, meaning the code we write in a **.java** file is transformed into _byte code_ by a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[compiler](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/compiler?page_ref=catalog)

before it is executed by the Java Virtual Machine on your computer.

A compiler is a program that translates human-friendly programming languages into other programming languages that computers can execute.

![Steps of Java Compilation](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/Java%20M1L1-%20Compilation%20Process%20ART%20409.png)

Previous exercises have automatically compiled and run the files for you. Off-platform development environments can also compile and run files for you, but it’s important to understand this aspect of Java development so we’ll do it ourselves.

The compiling process catches mistakes **before** the computer runs our code.

The Java compiler runs a series of checks while it transforms the code. Code that does not pass these checks will not be compiled.

This exercise will use an interactive terminal. Codecademy has a [lesson on the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) if you’d like to learn more.

For example, with a file called `Plankton.java`, we could compile it with the terminal command:

```
javac Plankton.java
```

A successful compilation produces a **.class** file: `Plankton.class`, that we execute with the terminal command:

```
java Plankton
```

An unsuccessful compilation produces a list of

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[errors](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors?page_ref=catalog)

. No **.class** file is made until the errors are corrected and the compile command is run again.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Let’s practice compiling and executing a file by entering commands in the terminal!

    Our text editor contains a broken program so we can see how compilers help us catch mistakes. **Don’t make any corrections!**

    In the terminal, type this command: `javac Compiling.java` and press enter or return. You will see an error message but don’t worry, we will resolve it in the next step.

    Click the Check Work button to check your work and move on to the next checkpoint.

    Hint

    Running commands in the terminal is a little different from how we’ve executed code so far.

    You’ll need to click into the terminal and type in the command.

    Press enter or return when you’ve typed the full command.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Do you see the error?

    The compiler is telling us one of the print statements is missing a semicolon.

    In the terminal, type `ls` and press return or enter.

    `ls` is short for "list" and this command lists all the available files.

    There is only one file: `Compiling.java`, we did not successfully compile the file because of the error.

    Click the Check Work button to move on to the next checkpoint.

    Hint

    Note that the `ls` command uses the letter `"l"` and the letter `"s"`, not the numeral `"1"`. If you type this command incorrectly, you will see a `command not found` error message.

    Press the Check Work button after you correctly type the command to progress through this checkpoint.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Add the missing semicolon in the text editor, then click the Check Work button.

    We’ll compile and execute this file in the next exercise!

    Hint

    The error message will tell you which line is missing a semicolon.

Hello World

### Compilation: Creating Executables

7 min

Compilation helped us catch an error. Now that we’ve corrected the file, let’s walk through a successful compilation.

As a reminder, we can compile a **.java** file from the terminal with the command:

```
javac Whales.java
```

If the file compiles successfully, this command produces an _executable_ class: **FileName.class**. Executable means we can run this program from the terminal.

We run the executable with the command:

```
java Whales
```

Note that we leave off the **.class** part of the filename.

Here’s a full compilation cycle as an example:

```
// within the file: Welcome.javapublic class Welcome {  public static void main(String[] args) {    System.out.println("Welcome to Codecademy's Java course!");  }}
```

We have one file: **Welcome.java**. We compile with the command:

```
javac Welcome.java
```

The terminal shows no

Preview: Docs In Java situations where things might go wrong in the program are predominantly handled by the Error and Exception classes.

[errors](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors)

, which indicates a successful compilation.

We now have two files:

1.  **Welcome.java**, our original file with Java syntax.
2.  **Welcome.class**, our compiled file with Java bytecode, ready to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine.

We can execute the compiled class with the command:

```
java Welcome
```

The following is printed to the screen:

```
Welcome to Codecademy's Java course!
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Let’s compile and execute our program!

    Run the `ls` command in the terminal to see the uncompiled **.java** file.

    Press the Check Work button after you finish each checkpoint.

    Hint

    The `l` in `ls` is the letter l, not the number 1.

    After you type `ls` in the terminal and press enter, it should look like:

    ```
    $ lsCompiling.java
    ```

    That means there’s currently a file named **Compiling.java** inside the folder.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Compile the file from the terminal and then press the Check Work button.

    Hint

    We compile files with the command:

    ```
    javac FileName.java
    ```

    If I wanted to compile a file named **Dog.java**, I would run:

    ```
    javac Dog.java
    ```

    The file name here is **Compiling.java**.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Enter `ls` again to see the new **.class** file.

    Run the executable file from the terminal and then press the Check Work button.

    Hint

    We can run Java files from the terminal by using `java` and the name of the executable class.

    For example, if I wanted to run `Dog.class`, I would enter `java Dog`.

-   Java programs have at least one class and one `main()` method.
    -   Each class represents one real-world idea.
    -   The `main()` method runs the tasks of the program.

-   Java has whitespace, curly braces, and semicolons.
    -   Whitespace is for humans to read code easily.
    -   Curly braces mark the scope of a class and method.
    -   Semicolons mark the end of a statement.
-   Java is a compiled language.
    -   Compiling catches mistakes in our code.
    -   Compilers transform code into an executable class.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    The text editor holds an empty file named **Review.java**. Fill it in!

    Define a `public class` named `Review`.

    Use opening and closing curly braces for the scope of the class.

    Remember, no semicolons for classes or methods!

    Hint

    We define a class in Java like so:

    ```
    public class MyClass {  // class code goes here}
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    This code produces an error because Java programs need a `main()` method.

    Define the `main()` method **within the curly braces** of the `Review` class.

    Hint

    Every Java program has one `main()` method with the following signature:

    ```
    public static void main(String[] args) {  // method code goes here}
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Inside of the curly braces for the `main()` method, write `The main method executes the tasks of the class` as a single-line comment.

    Hint

    We create a single-line comment like so:

    ```
    // Just a brief comment
    ```

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Below the comment, write a statement that prints the following: `My first Java program from scratch!`.

    Hint

    We can print a statement with the following syntax:

    ```
    System.out.println("Blah blah blah");
    ```
