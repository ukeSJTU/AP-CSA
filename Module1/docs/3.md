# Quiz: Hello World

## Question 1

The following code will run without an error.

### Code

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
        System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main()' method.");
        System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.")
    }
}
```

### Answer Choices

-   **False**: This code has a statement that does not end with a semicolon, which will cause an error.

## Question 2

What is missing from this Java program?

### Code

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
    // Covers the history of the Java programming language
}
```

### Answer Choices

-   **The `main()` method**: `public static void main(String[] args) {}`. Every program must have a `main()` method which executes the tasks of the program.

## Question 3

### Code

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

### Answer Choices

-   **HelloWorld.java**: The name of the file and the name of the class must match.

## Question 4

In Java, what is the purpose of leaving comments in code?

### Answer Choices

-   **They provide human readable notes that clarify thinking**: Comments help future readers of code understand your intentions.

## Question 5

Java is a compiled language, meaning the code we write is translated by another program into a language the computer understands.

        System.out.println("Hello Codey!");
    }
}
```

public class Timeline {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sun Microsystems announced the release of Java in 1995
        /*
        James Gosling is a Canadian engineer who created Java while
