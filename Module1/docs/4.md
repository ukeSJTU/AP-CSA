# Planting a Tree

## Project Brief

### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

### Planting a Tree

Introduce yourself to users and plant a tree for them!

## Tasks

### Creating the Class

**Task 1**

We’re starting with a blank Java file named **Tree.java**. Define a class that follows the Java naming conventions.

**Task 2**

This code produces an error because our program needs a `main()` method. Define this method inside the curly braces of the `Tree` class.

**Task 3**

Write a comment in `main()` that describes the task it will perform. We’re going to introduce ourselves and print a tree to the screen. You can use the single-line or multi-line syntax for your comment.

**Task 4**

Below your comment, print a message introducing yourself to the user. Try something like “Hey there, I’m Ariel and I’m learning to code in Java!” When you run the code, you should see this message printed to the screen.

### Planting Trees

**Task 5**

After introducing yourself, use another print statement to output the project goal! Something like “I’m going to plant a tree today!” or “Ready to get my hands dirty!”

**Task 6**

See how the second statement begins on a new line? We’ll use multiple print statements to plant our tree. For example:

```java
System.out.println("  *  ");
System.out.println(" *** ");
System.out.println(" *** ");
System.out.println("  *  ");
System.out.println("  *  ");
```

will print a tree like this:

```
  *
 ***
 ***
  *
  *
```

Try it out!

**Task 7**

Have fun and experiment with different trees. Here are a couple of examples:

```
 *
 ** *
 ******
  ****
    **
     **
 ~~~~~~~~~~
```

```
 *****
 *****
 *****
   *
     *
  #######
```

You can explore other printing methods in the [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#out).

### Code Example

```java
// Define your tree class in this file!
public class Tree {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Introduce myself and print a tree to the screen.
        System.out.println("Hey there, I’m uke and I’m learning to code in Java!");
        System.out.println("Ready to get my hands dirty!");
        System.out.println("  *  ");
        System.out.println(" *** ");
        System.out.println(" *** ");
        System.out.println("  *  ");
        System.out.println("  * ");
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Hey there, I’m uke and I’m learning to code in Java!
Ready to get my hands dirty!
  *
 ***
 ***
  *
  *
```
