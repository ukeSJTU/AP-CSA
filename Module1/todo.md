# TODO and Uncertainties for Module1 Transformation

## General Notes

-   All documents from Module1/docs/ have been transformed into slides, source code, and resources as per the instructions.
-   Package declaration errors in Java files were resolved by removing package statements, assuming they are not necessary for educational purposes in this context.

## Specific Uncertainties

-   **Image Handling**: Images referenced in the original documents (e.g., JVM diagram, autocomplete GIF, debugging screenshot) have been kept as URLs in the slides. A note is made to download these images to `assets/images/` folder for offline access.
    -   Action Needed: Download images from URLs to `Module1/slides/assets/images/`.
-   **Quiz Answer for Question 7**: The answer provided for correct comment syntax (`\\\\`) seems unclear or potentially incorrect. It may need clarification or correction to reflect the actual syntax used in the code example.
    -   Clarification Needed: Confirm the intended answer for comment syntax in the quiz.

## Additional Considerations

-   Ensure all external links in slides and resources are accessible and relevant.
-   Review the formatting of slides to ensure consistency across all files after auto-formatting by the editor.
