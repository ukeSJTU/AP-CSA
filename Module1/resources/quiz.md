# Quiz: Hello World

## Question 1: Code Error Check

-   **Question**: Will the following code run without an error?

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
        System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main()' method.");
        System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.")
    }
}
```

-   **Answer**: **False**: This code has a statement that does not end with a semicolon, which will cause an error.

## Question 2: Missing Component

-   **Question**: What is missing from this Java program?

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
    // Covers the history of the Java programming language
}
```

-   **Answer**: **The `main()` method**: `public static void main(String[] args) {}`. Every program must have a `main()` method which executes the tasks of the program.

## Question 3: File Naming

-   **Question**: What would the name of the file be if it contained the following code?

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

-   **Answer**: **HelloWorld.java**: The name of the file and the name of the class must match.

## Question 4: Purpose of Comments

-   **Question**: In Java, what is the purpose of leaving comments in code?

-   **Answer**: **They provide human readable notes that clarify thinking**: Comments help future readers of code understand your intentions.

## Question 5: Compiled Language

-   **Question**: Java is a compiled language, meaning the code we write is translated by another program into a language the computer understands.

-   **Answer**: **True**: Compiled Java classes are run on the Java Virtual Machine.

## Question 6: Output Prediction

-   **Question**: What will the following code print to the screen?

```java
public class HelloYou {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Codey!");
    }
}
```

-   **Answer**: **Hello Codey!**: The double quotes will not be printed.

## Question 7: Comment Syntax

-   **Question**: Comment the code with the correct syntax.

```java
public class Timeline {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sun Microsystems announced the release of Java in 1995
        /*
        James Gosling is a Canadian engineer who created Java while
        working at Sun Microsystems. His favorite number is the
        square root of 2!
        */
    }
}
```

-   **Answer**: **\\\\**: This represents the correct syntax for comments in the provided code.
