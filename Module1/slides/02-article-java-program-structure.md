# Java Program Structure

-   Java programs have a specific structure.
-   Let's analyze the Hello World program line by line.

---

# Case-Sensitivity

-   Java is a case-sensitive language.
-   Syntax must match the exact case (e.g., `System.out.println()` cannot be `system.out.println()`).

---

# Comments in Java

-   Comments document code and are ignored by the compiler.
-   Single-line comments use `//`.

---

# Classes in Java

-   All Java programs consist of at least one class.
-   Class name must match the file name (e.g., `HelloWorld` class in `HelloWorld.java`).
-   Uses Pascal Case (capitalize every word).
-   Curly braces `{}` define the scope of the class.

---

# Methods in Java

-   Every Java program must have a `main()` method.
-   `main()` holds the instructions for the program.
-   Methods are sequences of tasks for the computer to execute.

---

# Statements in Java

-   Statements perform a single task and end with a semicolon.
-   Example: `System.out.println("Hello World!");` outputs text to the terminal.
-   Uses dot notation (`.`) to access object parts like `System.out`.

---

# Whitespace in Java

-   Whitespace (tabs, spaces, newlines) is ignored by the compiler.
-   Used for readability, making code easier for humans to understand.
-   Indent and separate lines for clarity.
