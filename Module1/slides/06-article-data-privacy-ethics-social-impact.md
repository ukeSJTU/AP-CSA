## Data Privacy Risks

-   Example: [Facebook - Cambridge Analytica Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal)
    -   Personal data of millions acquired without consent for political advertising.
-   Programmers must protect user data and be aware of privacy risks in software.

# System Reliability and Legal Considerations

-   **System Reliability**: Probability that technology works as intended.
-   Example: Would you trust a driverless car with 70% reliability?
-   Programmers should maximize reliability in products.

## Legal Considerations

-   **Intellectual Property (IP)**: Rights over creations of the mind.
    -   Categories: Trade secrets, Trademarks, Patents, Copyright.
-   Violating IP rights can lead to legal action, even if accidental.

# Ethical and Social Impacts

-   Software influences culture, economy, and society, with both positive and negative effects:
    -   **Machine Learning**: Benefits in automation, but issues with data bias affecting marginalized communities.
    -   **Social Media**: Enhances connectivity, but spreads misinformation.
    -   **AI Decisions**: Ethical dilemmas, e.g., driverless car prioritizing passenger safety over others.

# Conclusion

-   Software has real-world consequences, both positive and negative.
-   Programmers bear responsibility to understand these impacts.
-   Strive to ensure safe, ethical experiences for users through informed development.
