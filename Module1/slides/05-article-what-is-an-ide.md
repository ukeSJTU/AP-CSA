# What Is an IDE?

-   Learn about the Integrated Development Environment, an application that makes programming easier.

# Definition of IDE

-   **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment
-   Combines common programming activities into a single application:
    -   Editing source code
    -   Building executables
    -   Debugging

---

# Editing Source Code

-   IDEs facilitate writing code with features like:
    -   **Syntax Highlighting**: Visual cues for keywords and syntax elements.
    -   **Autocomplete**: Predicts and completes code as you type, saving keystrokes.

## Syntax Highlighting Example

-   Makes code easier to read by color-coding different elements.
-   Example: Keywords like `class` are highlighted differently from other text.

---

# Building Executables

-   Java requires compilation from **.java** to **.class** files before running.
-   IDEs automate the build process, abstracting away manual compilation steps.
-   Allows focus on coding rather than compilation commands.

---

# Debugging in IDEs

-   IDEs provide tools to inspect code and variables when errors occur.
-   Offer hints during coding to prevent errors before compilation.
-   Essential for identifying and fixing bugs efficiently.

# Coding on Your Computer

-   IDEs enable coding and running Java programs locally.
-   Recommended IDE: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    -   Available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
-   Prerequisite: [Download and install Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
