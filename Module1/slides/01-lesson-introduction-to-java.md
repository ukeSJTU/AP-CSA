# Introduction to Java

Welcome to the world of Java programming!

-   Java was released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
-   Known for being simple, portable, secure, and robust.
-   Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows "write once, run everywhere".
-   Programming languages use syntax to create programs executed by computers.

# Hello World Program

-   Java files have a `.java` extension.
-   Each file has one primary class named after the file.
-   The `main()` method lists program tasks.

# Print Statements

-   Use `System.out.println()` to output information to a new line.
-   Use `System.out.print()` to output on the same line.

## Examples of Print Statements

-   `println()` moves cursor to next line after output.
-   `print()` keeps cursor on the same line.

# Commenting Code

-   Comments are notes for human readers, not executed by the computer.
-   Single-line comments use `//`.
-   Multi-line comments use `/*` and `*/`.
-   Javadoc comments use `/**` and `*/` for documentation.

# Semicolons and Whitespace

-   Whitespace is for human readability, not interpreted by Java.
-   Semicolons mark the end of a statement.
-   Curly braces define scope of classes and methods, no semicolons needed.

# Compilation: Catching Errors

-   Java is a compiled language; code is transformed into byte code.
-   Compiler catches mistakes before execution.
-   Use `javac FileName.java` to compile, `java FileName` to run.

# Java Review

-   Java programs have at least one class and one `main()` method.
-   Comments add context for readers.
-   Whitespace, curly braces, and semicolons structure code.
-   Compilation transforms code into executable class files.
