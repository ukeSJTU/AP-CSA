# String Methods | Codecademy

# Welcome to a Deeper Dive Into Classes

Let’s take a look at what’s coming up in the next section of the path!

In this section of the path, we’re going to continue our investigation of Java classes. We’ll start by looking at the String class in more detail. There are a number of important String methods that we’ll be using throughout the rest of the path.

After spending more time with Strings, we’ll dive into some of the more advanced features of Classes. Specifically, we’ll look at how to set the access of class variables and methods, discuss the concept of encapsulation, and write our own static methods.

Let’s get started!
