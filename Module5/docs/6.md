# Conditionals and Control Flow

## Quiz: Conditionals and Control Flow

### Question 1

The `break` keyword is important in a `switch` statement due to which of the following?

#### Answer Choices

-   It is necessary whenever the `switch` statement contains more than 4 cases.
-   Java will return an error if it is not specified.
-   **Correct Answer:** `Without break, Java will continue to check other cases in the switch statement.`  
    Without `break`, Java will continue to check other cases in the `switch` statement.
-   Without it, the `switch` statement will not execute.

### Question 2

What will the following code print?

#### Code

```java
if (5 > 6) {
    System.out.println("C. Senor");
} else if (6 < 5) {
    System.out.println("Sue Yu");
} else {
    System.out.println("Jim Sox");
}
```

#### Answer Choices

-   **Correct Answer:** `Jim Sox`  
    `5 > 6` returns `false` and also `6 < 5` returns `false`. So the `else` statement is run.
-   A blank line.
-   `C. Senor`
-   `Sue Yu`

### Question 3

The AND logical operator is represented in Java by which operator?

#### Answer Choices

-   `!`
-   `||`
-   **Correct Answer:** `&&`
-   `and`

### Question 4

The following Boolean expression will be evaluated to what value?

#### Code

```java
!(false) && (5 > 4)
```

#### Answer Choices

-   `false`
-   `unknown`
-   **Correct Answer:** `true`  
    `!(false)` returns `true` and `(5 > 4)` is also true. `true && true` is `true`!
-   `(5 > 4)`

### Question 5

The OR logical operator is represented in Java by which operator?

#### Answer Choices

-   `!`
-   `&&`
-   `OR`
-   **Correct Answer:** `||`

### Question 6

If multiple conditional operators are placed in a single expression, which operator gets evaluated first?

#### Answer Choices

-   The AND operator - `&&`
-   **Correct Answer:** `The NOT operator - !`  
    The order of evaluation is: the NOT operator (`!`) -> the AND operator (`&&`) -> the OR operator (`||`)
-   An expression cannot contain more than one conditional operator.
-   The OR operator - `||`

### Question 7

What will the following code print?

#### Code

```java
int choice = 5;
switch (choice) {
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Jo Fraizer");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Laila A. Lee");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Hall E. Home");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println(200);
}
```

#### Answer Choices

-   `Jo Fraizer`
-   **Correct Answer:** `Laila A. Lee`  
    `choice` is `5` so `case 5`'s code block will run.
-   `Hall E. Home`
-   `200`
