### Introduction to Control Flow

1 min

Imagine we’re writing a program that enrolls students in courses.

-   _If_ a student has completed the prerequisites, _then_ they can enroll in a course.
-   _Else_, they need to take the prerequisite courses.

They can’t take Physics II without finishing Physics I.

We represent this kind of decision-making in our program using

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[_conditional_](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/conditionals?page_ref=catalog)

or _control flow_ statements. Before this point, our code runs line-by-line from the top down, but conditional statements allow us to be selective in which portions will run.

Conditional statements check a

[`boolean`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/boolean)

condition and run a _block_ of code depending on the condition. Curly braces mark the

of a conditional block similar to a

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

or class.

Here’s a complete conditional statement:

```
if (true) {  System.out.println("Hello World!");}
```

If the condition is `true`, then the block is run. So `Hello World!` is printed.

But suppose the condition is different:

```
if (false) {  System.out.println("Hello World!");}
```

If the condition is `false`, then the block does not run.

This code is also called _if-then_ statements: “If `(condition)` is `true`, then do something”.

### If-Then Statement

The _if-then_ statement is the most simple

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[control flow](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/control-flow)

we can write. It tests an expression for truth and executes some code based on it.

```
if (flip == 1) {  System.out.println("Heads!");}
```

-   The `if` keyword marks the beginning of the conditional statement, followed by parentheses `()`.
-   The parentheses hold a

    Preview: Docs Loading link description

    [`boolean`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/boolean)

    datatype.

For the condition in parentheses we can also use

Preview: Docs Stores data that can be manipulated and referenced throughout the code.

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

that reference a boolean, or comparisons that evaluate to a boolean.

The boolean condition is followed by opening and closing curly braces that mark a block of code. This block runs if, and only if, the boolean is `true`.

```
boolean isValidPassword = true;if (isValidPassword) {  System.out.println("Password accepted!");}// Prints "Password accepted!"int numberOfItemsInCart = 9;if (numberOfItemsInCart > 12) {  System.out.println("Express checkout not available");}// Nothing is printed.
```

If a conditional is brief we can omit the curly braces entirely:

```
if (true) System.out.println("Brevity is the soul of wit");
```

**Note:** Conditional statements do not end in a semicolon.

### If-Then-Else

4 min

We’ve seen how to conditionally execute one block of code, but what if there are two possible blocks of code we’d like to execute?

Let’s say _if_ a student has the required prerequisite, _then_ they enroll in the selected course, _else_ they’re enrolled in the prerequisite course instead.

We create an alternate conditional branch with the `else` keyword:

```
if (hasPrerequisite) {  // Enroll in course} else {  // Enroll in prerequisite}
```

This conditional statement ensures that exactly one code block will be run. If the condition, `hasPrerequisite`, is `false`, the block after `else` runs.

There are now two separate code blocks in our conditional statement. The first block runs if the condition evaluates to `true`, the second block runs if the condition evaluates to `false`.

This code is also called an _if-then-else_ statement:

-   If _condition_ is true, then do something.
-   Else, do a different thing.

    In the code editor, there is an `isFilled` value, that represents whether the order is ready to ship.

    Write an if-then-else statement that:

    -   When `isFilled` is `true`, print `Shipping`.
    -   When `isFilled` is `false`, print `Order not ready`.

    Hint

### If-Then-Else-If

11 min

The conditional structure we’ve learned can be chained together to check as many conditions as are required by our program.

Imagine our program is now selecting the appropriate course for a student. We’ll check their submission to find the correct course enrollment.

The conditional statement now has multiple conditions that are evaluated from the top down:

```
String course = "Theatre";if (course.equals("Biology")) {  // Enroll in Biology course} else if (course.equals("Algebra")) {  // Enroll in Algebra course} else if (course.equals("Theatre")) {  // Enroll in Theatre course} else {  System.out.println("Course not found!");}
```

**The first** condition to evaluate to `true` will have that code block run. Here’s an example demonstrating the order:

```
int testScore = 72;if (testScore >= 90) {  System.out.println("A");} else if (testScore >= 80) {  System.out.println("B");} else if (testScore >= 70) {  System.out.println("C");} else if (testScore >= 60) {  System.out.println("D");} else {  System.out.println("F");}// prints: C
```

This chained conditional statement has two conditions that evaluate `true`. Because `testScore >= 70` comes before `testScore >= 60`, only the earlier code block is run.

**Note:** Only one of the code blocks will run.

    We need to calculate the shipping costs for our orders.

    There’s a new instance field, `String shipping`, that we use to calculate the cost.

    Use a chained `if-then-else` to check for different values within the `calculateShipping()` method.

    When the `shipping` instance field equals `"Regular"`, the method should return `0`.

    When the `shipping` instance field equals `"Express"`, the method should return `1.75`.

    Else the method should return `.50`.

    Hint

    Here’s the general structure of `if-then-else-if`:

    ```
    if (condition) {  // Do something} else if (differentCondition) {  // Do something else} else {  // Do ANOTHER something else}
    ```

    The `shipping` instance field is a `String` so we’ll need to use `equals()` for our condition. Here’s how we’d write a simple `if-then`:

    ```
    if (shipping.equals("Coolest beans")) {  // equals() returned true!}
    ```

Conditionals and Control Flow

### Nested Conditional Statements

8 min

We can create more complex conditional structures by creating _nested conditional statements_, which is created by placing conditional statements inside other conditional statements:

```pseudo
if (outer condition) {
  if (nested condition) {
    Instruction to execute if both conditions are true
  }
}
```

When we implement nested conditional statements, the outer statement is evaluated first. If the outer condition is `true`, then the inner, nested statement is evaluated.

Let’s create a program that helps us decide what to wear based on the weather:

```
int temp = 45;boolean raining = true;if (temp < 60) {  System.out.println("Wear a jacket!");  if (raining == true) {    System.out.println("Bring your umbrella.");  } else {    System.out.println("Leave your umbrella home.");  }}
```

In the code snippet above, our compiler will check the condition in the first `if-then` statement: `temp < 60`. Since `temp` has a value of `45`, this condition is `true`; therefore, our program will print `Wear a jacket!`.

Then, we’ll evaluate the condition of the nested `if-then` statement: `raining == true`. This condition is also `true`, so `Bring your umbrella` is also printed to the screen.

Note that, if the first condition was `false`, the nested condition would not be evaluated.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    The company offers a temporary deal that, if the consumer uses the coupon `"ship50"`, the company will reduce the express shipping price.

    Let’s rewrite the body of `else`\-`if` statement from the last exercise. Inside the `else`\-`if` statement, create a nested `if-then` statement that checks if `couponCode` equals `"ship50"`.

    If the nested condition is `true`, return the value `.85`.

    If the condition is `false`, use a nested `else` statement to return the value `1.75`.

    Hint

    The solution should look similar to the example below:

    ```
    public double calculateShipping() {  if (shipping.equals("Regular")) {    return 0;  } else if (shipping.equals("Express")) {    // Add your code here    if (couponCode.equals("couponCodeValue")) {      // return discounted shipping value    } else {      // return full shipping value    }  } else {    return .50;  }}
    ```

Conditionals and Control Flow

### Switch Statement

11 min

An alternative to chaining if-then-else conditions together is to use the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[`switch`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/switch?page_ref=catalog)

statement. This conditional will check a given value against any number of conditions and run the code block where there is a match.

Here’s an example of our course selection conditional as a `switch` statement instead:

```
String course = "History";switch (course) {  case "Algebra":     // Enroll in Algebra    break;   case "Biology":     // Enroll in Biology    break;  case "History":     // Enroll in History    break;  case "Theatre":    // Enroll in Theatre    break;  default:    System.out.println("Course not found");}
```

This example enrolls the student in History class by checking the value contained in the parentheses, `course`, against each of the `case` labels. If the value after the case label matches the value within the parentheses, the _switch block_ is run.

In the above example, `course` references the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[string](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

`"History"`, which matches `case "History":`.

When no value matches, the `default` block runs. Think of this as the `else` equivalent.

Switch blocks are different than other code blocks because they are not marked by curly braces and we use the `break` keyword to exit the switch statement.

Without `break`, code below the matching `case` label is run, _including code under other case labels_, which is rarely the desired behavior.

```
String course = "Biology";switch (course) {  case "Algebra":     // Enroll in Algebra  case "Biology":     // Enroll in Biology  case "History":     // Enroll in History  case "Theatre":    // Enroll in Theatre  default:    System.out.println("Course not found");}// enrolls student in Biology... AND History and Theatre!
```

Instructions

    We’ll rewrite the `calculateShipping()` method so it uses a `switch` statement instead.

    There’s an uninitialized variable `shippingCost` in `calculateShipping()`. Assign the correct value to `shippingCost` using a `switch` statement:

    We’ll check the value of the instance field `shipping`.

    -   When `shipping` matches `"Regular"`, `shippingCost` should be `0`.
    -   When `shipping` matches `"Express"`, `shippingCost` should be `1.75`.
    -   The default should assign `.50` to `shippingCost`.

    **Make sure the method returns `shippingCost` after the `switch` statement.**

    Hint

    Here’s the general structure of a `switch` statement:

    ```
    switch (value) {    case possibleMatchingValue:    // do something    break;  case anotherPossibleMatching:    // do another thing    break;  default:    // do this if nothing else matched}
    ```

    We want to assign the correct value inside the matching `case`:

    ```
    case "Regular":  shippingCost = 0;  break;
    ```

### Review

Before this lesson, our code executed from top to bottom, line by line.

Conditional statements add branching paths to our programs. We use

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[conditionals](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/conditionals)

to make decisions in the program so that different inputs will produce different results.

Conditionals have the general structure:

```
if (condition) {    // consequent path} else {    // alternative path}
```

Specific conditional statements have the following behavior:

-   `if-then`:
    -   code block runs if condition is true
-   `if-then-else`:
    -   one block runs if conditions is true
    -   another block runs if condition is false
-   `if-then-else` chained:
    -   same as `if-then` but an arbitrary number of conditions
-   `switch`:
    -   switch block runs if condition value matches `case` value

Instructions

Our complete `Order` program is in the text editor but the `main()` method is empty.

Create different `Order` instances and see if you can run the code in all the different conditional blocks!
