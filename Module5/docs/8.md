# Conditionals and Control Flow

## Continents and Cities

### Project Brief

#### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

#### Overview

Planet Earth is a magical place. Let's practice the Java switch statement that you learned about.

Write a **Continents.java** program that will print out a continent and the largest city in that continent, based on the value of an integer.

The instructions provided are general guidelines. Upon completion of the project, feel free to add functionality of your own.

### Tasks

1. Let's create a skeleton for the program. Add:

    ```java
    public class Continents {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
      }
    }
    ```

    > Hint
    >
    > The `main()` is the main function that houses your program.

2. Write a comment near the top of the program that describes what the program does.

    > Hint
    >
    > ```java
    > // Continents and their largest cities.
    > ```

3. Create an `int` variable called `continent` and set it equal to `4`.

    > Hint
    >
    > ```java
    > int continent = 4;
    > ```

4. Create a `switch` statement that will switch based on the value of `continent`.

    > Hint
    >
    > ```java
    > switch (continent) {
    > }
    > ```

5. Inside of the switch statement, add a `case` that will run when the value of `continent` is `1`.
6. When the value of `continent` is `1`, print out `North America: Mexico City, Mexico`.
7. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
8. Add another `case` that will run when the value of `continent` is `2`. When this value is met, print out `South America: Sao Paulo, Brazil`.
9. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
10. Add another `case` that will run when the value of `continent` is `3`. When this value is met, print out `Europe: Moscow, Russia`. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
11. Add another `case` that will run when the value of `continent` is `4`. When this value is met, print out `Africa: Lagos, Nigeria`. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
12. Add another `case` that will run when the value of `continent` is `5`. When this value is met, print out `Asia: Shanghai, China`. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
13. Add another `case` that will run when the value of `continent` is `6`. When this value is met, print out `Australia: Sydney, Australia`. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
14. Add another `case` that will run when the value of `continent` is `7`. When this value is met, print out `Antarctica: McMurdo Station, US`. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
15. Finally, add the `default` case. The `default` case should print out `Undefined continent!` Make sure the next line exits out of the case.
16. If the program is written correctly, your output should be `Africa: Lagos, Nigeria`.

### Solution Code

```java
/*
Continents.java program that will print out a continent and the largest city in that continent, based on the value of an integer.
*/

public class Continents {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int continent = 4;

    switch (continent) {
      case 1:
        System.out.println("North America: Mexico City, Mexico");
        break;
      case 2:
        System.out.println("South America: Sao Paulo, Brazil");
        break;
      case 3:
        System.out.println("Europe: Moscow, Russia");
        break;
      case 4:
        System.out.println("Africa: Lagos, Nigeria");
        break;
      case 5:
        System.out.println("Asia: Shanghai, China");
        break;
      case 6:
        System.out.println("Australia: Sydney, Australia");
        break;
      case 7:
        System.out.println("Antarctica: McMurdo Station, US");
        break;
      default:
        System.out.println("Undefined continent!");
    }
  }
}
```

### Output

```
Africa: Lagos, Nigeria
```
