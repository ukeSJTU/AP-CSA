# TODO: Module 5 Transformation Notes

## General Notes

-   Ensure all image references in slides are preserved as-is. Images need to be downloaded to the `assets/images/` folder for offline access. This task is pending and requires manual intervention or a script to fetch images from URLs provided in the original content.
-   Verify that all code examples, exercises, and project files are correctly formatted and functional. Some Java files may require package declarations or additional imports depending on the project structure.

## Specific Uncertainties

1. **Informational Document (1.md)**:
    - The title slide content was transformed based on the provided text. Confirm if additional objectives or introductory content should be included.
2. **Lesson Documents (2.md and 3.md)**:
    - Exercises were inferred for starter and solution files based on instructions. Validate if the TODO comments in starter files are clear enough for student understanding.
    - Some code examples might need additional context or comments for clarity. Review if further explanation is necessary in slides or source files.
3. **Article Documents (4.md and 5.md)**:
    - Focused on key points for slides. Ensure that the depth of explanation is sufficient for educational purposes or if more detailed content should be added.
4. **Quiz Document (6.md)**:
    - Questions and answers were formatted for slides and resources. Confirm if the vertical slide structure for answers is effective for presentation.
5. **Project Documents (7.md and 8.md)**:
    - Starter and solution files were created based on provided code and instructions. Verify if additional test cases or edge cases should be included in solutions.
    - README.md was updated to include both projects. Check if the format and detail level are appropriate for student guidance.

## Pending Actions

-   Download and store images referenced in the original markdown files to `slides/assets/images/`.
-   Review all transformed content for consistency in tone, detail, and educational value as per the original materials.
-   Confirm with stakeholders if additional features or modifications to the projects (e.g., user input for continent selection) should be implemented.
