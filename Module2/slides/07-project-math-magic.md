# Math Magic Project

## Objective

-   Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java) by creating a program that performs a mathematical magic trick.
-   Perform arithmetic operations on an integer to achieve a surprising result.

---

# Project Description

-   Write a program that takes an initial number and performs a series of arithmetic operations.
-   The goal is to always result in the same final value, demonstrating a mathematical trick.

## Key Concepts

-   Use of variables and arithmetic operations.
-   Understanding of integer range to avoid overflow.
-   Application of compound assignment operators for a challenge task.

---

# Project Requirements

-   **Initialize**: Set an original number (`myNumber`) between -46,341 and 46,340.
-   **Steps**: Perform a series of operations (square, add, divide, etc.) to reach the final result.
-   **Output**: Print the final result, which should always be the same regardless of the initial number.
-   **Challenge**: Recreate the project using only two variables with compound operators.

## Implementation Details

-   Starter and solution code available in:
    -   Starter: `../src/projects/MathMagic_Starter/`
    -   Solution: `../src/projects/MathMagic_Solution/`
-   Follow the step-by-step tasks to build the program.
-   Test with different numbers within the specified range to see the "magic" result.
