Strings

```
// Creating a String variableString name = "Bob";// The following will print "false" because strings are case-sensitiveSystem.out.println(name.equals("bob"));
```

A String in Java is a Object that holds multiple characters. It is not a primitive datatype.

A String can be created by placing characters between a pair of double quotes (`"`).

To compare Strings, the `equals()` method must be used instead of the primitive equality comparator `==`.

Primitive Data Types

```
int age = 28; char grade = 'A';boolean late = true;byte b = 20;long num1 = 1234567;short no = 10;float k = (float)12.5;double pi = 3.14;
```

Java’s most basic data types are known as _primitive data types_ and are in the system by default.

The available types are as follows:

-   `int`
-   `char`
-   `boolean`
-   `byte`
-   `long`
-   `short`
-   `double`
-   `float`

`null` is another, but it can only ever store the value `null`.

Increment and Decrement Operators

```
int numApples = 5;numApples++; // Value is now 6int numOranges = 5;numOranges--; // Value is now 4
```

The increment operator, (`++`), can increase the value of a number-based variable by `1` while the decrement operator, (`--`), can decrease the value of a variable by `1`.

Static Typing

```
int i = 10;         // type is intchar ch = 'a';      // type is charj = 20;             // won't compile, no type is givenchar name = "Lil";  // won't compile, wrong data type
```

In Java, the type of a variable is checked at compile time. This is known as _static typing_. It has the advantage of catching the errors at compile time rather than at execution time.

Variables must be declared with the appropriate data type or the program will not compile.

Comparison Operators

```
int a = 5;int b = 3;boolean result = a > b;// result now holds the boolean value true
```

Comparison operators can be used to compare two values:

-   `>` greater than
-   `<` less than
-   `>=` greater than or equal to
-   `<=` less than or equal to
-   `==` equal to
-   `!=` not equal to

They are supported for primitive data types and the result of a comparison is a boolean value `true` or `false`.
