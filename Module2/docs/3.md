# Java Variables: Mad Libs Project

## Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java) by creating a Mad Libs word game using Java. Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in, often resulting in funny or strange outcomes.

Mad Libs require:

-   A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
-   Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

For this project, a story is provided, and your task is to:

1. Create all the variables needed for the story.
2. Print the story with the variables in the right places.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll write a Mad Libs game based on a provided story template. Let's begin by setting up the necessary variables and completing the story.

## Tasks

### 1. Program Description Comment

Create a comment that describes the program. Use a multi-line comment to include details such as the purpose of the program, author, and date.

### 2. Review the Story Template

Examine the variable named `story`. It contains a string that will form the basis of our Mad Libs story. All variables used in this story must be declared and initialized for the code to compile without errors.

### 3. Main Character

The story needs a protagonist. Create a `String` called `name1` to store the name of the main character.

### 4. Adjectives

Provide three adjectives for the story. Create three `String` variables: `adjective1`, `adjective2`, and `adjective3`, and initialize them with different adjectives.

### 5. Verb

The story requires one verb. Create a `String` called `verb1` and store a verb in it.

### 6. Nouns

The story also needs six nouns. Create six `String` variables: `noun1`, `noun2`, `noun3`, `noun4`, `noun5`, and `noun6`, and initialize them with your favorite nouns.

### 7. Secondary Character

Declare a `String` variable called `name2` and initialize it with another name for a secondary character in the story.

### 8. Number

The story requires one number. Declare an `int` variable called `number` and set it to any whole number you like.

### 9. Place

Declare a `String` called `place1` and store any place in it. This could be a city, town, country, or even a planet!

### 10. Compile Check

Ensure all variables are declared and initialized. Save the file to check if it compiles without errors.

### 11. Print the Story

Use `System.out.println()` to print the `story` variable and see the completed Mad Libs story.

### 12. Interactive Fun

Add whitespace in your code to hide the `story` variable. Show your friends the code and have them fill in the variables with their own nouns, adjectives, verbs, and names. Then, run the code to reveal a new story!

## Code Example

```java
public class MadLibs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
        This program generates a mad libbed story.
        Author: uke
        Date: 4/9/2025
        */

        String name1 = "Peter";
        String adjective1 = "great";
        String adjective2 = "good";
        String adjective3 = "beautiful";
        String verb1 = "sing";
        String noun1 = "cow";
        String noun2 = "chicken";
        String noun3 = "egg";
        String noun4 = "milk";
        String noun5 = "grass";
        String noun6 = "flower";
        String name2 = "Alice";
        int number = 10;
        String place1 = "farm";

        // The template for the story
        String story = "This morning " + name1 + " woke up feeling " + adjective1 + ". 'It is going to be a " + adjective2 + " day!' Outside, a bunch of " + noun1 + "s were protesting to keep " + noun2 + " in stores. They began to " + verb1 + " to the rhythm of the " + noun3 + ", which made all the " + noun4 + "s very " + adjective3 + ". Concerned, " + name1 + " texted " + name2 + ", who flew " + name1 + " to " + place1 + " and dropped " + name1 + " in a puddle of frozen " + noun5 + ". " + name1 + " woke up in the year " + number + ", in a world where " + noun6 + "s ruled the world.";

        System.out.println(story);
    }
}
```

## Output

```
This morning Peter woke up feeling great. 'It is going to be a good day!' Outside, a bunch of cows were protesting to keep chicken in stores. They began to sing to the rhythm of the egg, which made all the milks very beautiful. Concerned, Peter texted Alice, who flew Peter to farm and dropped Peter in a puddle of frozen grass. Peter woke up in the year 10, in a world where flowers ruled the world.
