# Math Magic

## Project Brief

### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

### Math Magic

In this project, you will become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you choose.

The instructions provided are general guidelines. Upon completion of the project, feel free to explore the code on your own.

### Tasks

11/11 complete

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1.

Create an `int` variable called `myNumber`.

Set it equal to any integer other than 0.

Hint

To declare and initialize:

```
int myNumber = 2;
```

Remember that the semicolon `;` is used to end Java statements.

For this code to work properly, `myNumber` must be between -46341 and 46340.

2.

We will refer to `myNumber` as the original number from now on - it might be helpful to document this.

Write a comment in the program that documents this.

Hint

Single line comments are one line comments that begin with two forward slashes:

```
// I'm a single line comment!
```

It would be helpful to let other programmers know that `myNumber` is the original number:

```
// myNumber is the original number
```

3.

Create an `int` variable called `stepOne`.

Set it equal to the original number (`myNumber`) multiplied by itself.

Hint

Suppose you want to create an `int` variable called `tons` and set it equal to 4 × 4, you would write:

```
int tons = 4 * 4;
```

4.

Create an `int` variable called `stepTwo`.

Set it equal to the previous result (`stepOne`) plus the original number (`myNumber`).

Hint

Suppose you want to create an `int` variable called `two` and set it equal to 1 + 1, you would write:

```
int two = 1 + 1;
```

5.

Create an `int` variable called `stepThree`.

Set it equal to the previous result (`stepTwo`) divided by the original number.

Hint

To perform a division, use the forward slash `/`:

```
int quotient = 45 / 3;
```

6.

Create an `int` variable called `stepFour`.

Set it equal to the previous result (`stepThree`) plus `17`.

7.

Create an `int` variable called `stepFive`.

Set it equal to the previous result (`stepFour`) minus the original number.

Hint

To perform a subtraction, use the `-`:

```
int subtraction = 20 - 15;
```

8.

Create an `int` variable called `stepSix`.

Set it equal to the previous result (`stepFive`) divided by `6`.

9.

Print out the value of the last step.

Then, save and run your code!

What number is printed to the console?

Hint

```
System.out.println(stepSix);
```

10.

Now, go back to your code and change `myNumber` to any other integer. Run your program again.

Is the output the same?

It’s math magic!

**Note**: Due to the range of the [`int` primitive data type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html), only set `myNumber` to integer values between -46,341 and 46,340 (both inclusive). Values outside of this range for `myNumber` will cause the value of `stepOne` to exceed the maximum possible value of `int` when we multiply `myNumber` by itself, which can cause the program to produce unexpected results!

Hint

`3` will be printed to the console no matter what integer you choose as the original number!

Want to know why?

Suppose `myNumber` is x:

**( ( ( x² + x ) / x ) + 17 - x ) / 6**

**\= ( ( x + 1 ) + 17 - x ) / 6**

**\= ( x + 18 - x ) / 6**

**\= 18 / 6**

**\= 3**

Great job completing this project! Want to keep challenging yourself?

Recreate this project using only two variables: `myNumber` and `magicNumber`. Use your understanding of compound assignment operators to recreate the above program by only manipulating `magicNumber`.

See the **Hint** for more help.

Hint

Here are the steps for accomplishing this task:

-   First, create the `myNumber` variable and set it equal to any number that is not `0`.

```
int myNumber = 15; // Can be any number
```

-   Then, declare a variable called `magicNumber` and initialize it to have the value `myNumber * myNumber`:

```
int magicNumber = myNumber * myNumber;
```

-   Next, use the `+=` compound assignment operator to increase the value of `magicNumber` by `myNumber`:

```
magicNumber += myNumber;
```

-   Use `/=` to divide `magicNumber` by `myNumber`:

```
magicNumber /= myNumber;
```

-   Use `+=` in increase `magicNumber` by `17`:

```
magicNumber += 17;
```

-   Decrease `magicNumber` by `myNumber` using `-=`:

```
magicNumber -= myNumber;
```

-   Then, use `/=` to divide `magicNumber` by `6`:

```
magicNumber /= 6;
```

-   Finally, print the value of `magicNumber` to check that your program works correctly!
