, we know how to store a balance! We’d use a `double`, the primitive type that can hold big decimal numbers. But how would we deposit and withdraw from the account?

Lucky for us, we have the ability to manipulate the value of our variables. We can use expressions, arithmetic

[operators](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/operators)

, and more in order to change our variables’ values.

For example, Java has built-in arithmetic operations that perform calculations on numeric values:

```
// declare initial balancedouble balance = 20000.99;// declare deposit amountdouble depositAmount = 1000.00;// store result of calculation in our original variablebalance = balance + depositAmount;
```

In the final line of the code above, we used the expression `balance + depositAmount` to determine the new value of the `balance` variable. When an expression is executed, it produces a single value.

The data type of a variable plays a large role in the operations we can use to manipulate it. We can think of a data type as a combination of a set of values, and a set of operations on those values. For example, the `double` data type is comprised of values like `4.8` and operations like addition (`+`). For now, we’ll mainly focus on the set of operations that can be used on numbers and booleans.

The data type of an expression is determined by the resulting value. For example, an expression that uses two `int` values will evaluate to an `int` value. If an expression contains a `double` value, then the resulting value will also be type `double`.

Throughout this lesson, we will learn how to manipulate variables of different

    In the file **GuessingGame.java**, we have defined two integers `mystery1` and `mystery2`.

    Use `System.out.println()` to print the variable that holds a value of `2`.

    Hint

    To determine which variable holds the value of `2`, you’ll need to compare the values of `mystery1` and `mystery2`. If one of has a value of `2`, print that variable’s name using `System.out.println()`.

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### Addition and Subtraction

7 min

In our bank account example from the last exercise, we used the `+` operator to add the values `balance` and `depositAmount`:

```
double balance = 20000.99;double depositAmount = 1000.0;balance = balance + depositAmount;// balance now holds 21000.99
```

If we wanted to withdraw from the balance, we would use the `-` operator:

```
double withdrawAmount = 500;balance = balance - withdrawAmount;// balance now holds 20500.99
```

Addition and subtraction work with `int` type values as well! If we had `60` pictures of cats on our phone, and we took `24` more, we could use the following line of code to store `84` in `numPicturesOfCats`.

```
int numPicturesOfCats = 60 + 24;
```

What if we took one additional picture of our cat? We can reflect this change using an increment operator `++`. When we append `++` to a number-based variable, it increases the value by `1`. We also have the decrement operator, `--`, which decreases the value by `1`.

```
// Take a picturenumPicturesOfCats++ // Value is now 85// Delete a picturenumPicturesOfCats-- // Value is now 84
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Create an `int` variable called `animalsInZoo` that holds the amount of zebras plus the amount of giraffes at the zoo.

    Then, print your `animalsInZoo` variable.

    Hint

    To create the `animalsInZoo` variable, you’ll need to declare an `int` variable and assign it the sum of the number of zebras and giraffes. To print the variable, you can use the `System.out.println()` function.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Two of the zebras have been traded to a neighboring rival zoo. Subtract 2 from the number of zebras and store the result in a variable called `numZebrasAfterTrade`.

    Then, print the `numZebrasAfterTrade` variable!

    Hint

    To subtract `2` from the number of zebras, you can use the `-` operator. Assign the result to the variable `numZebrasAfterTrade`. Don’t forget to print the variable to see the result!

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### Multiplication and Division

7 min

Let’s say that our employer is calculating our paycheck and depositing it to our bank account. We worked 40 hours last week, at a rate of $15.50 an hour. Java can calculate this with the multiplication operator `*`:

```
double paycheckAmount = 40 * 15.50;//paycheckAmount now holds 620.0
```

If we want to see how many hours our total balance represents, we use the division operator `/`:

```
double balance = 20010.5;double hourlyRate = 15.5;double hoursWorked = balance / hourlyRate;//hoursWorked now holds 1291.0
```

Division has different results with integers. The `/` operator does _integer division_, which means that any remainder is lost.

```
int evenlyDivided = 10 / 5;//evenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 5 is 2int unevenlyDivided = 10 / 4;//unevenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 4 is 2.5
```

`evenlyDivided` stores what you expect, but `unevenlyDivided` holds `2` because `int`s cannot store decimals! It’s important to note that the `int` doesn’t round the decimal, but floors it. Java removes the `0.5` to fit the result into an `int` type!

It’s important to note that if we try to divide any number by `0`, we will get an

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    In `main()`, there is a variable called `subtotal`, which represents the subtotal of an amount to pay on a bill, and a variable called `tax`, which represents the tax rate that will be applied to that subtotal.

    Create a `double` variable, `total`, that holds `subtotal` plus the product of `subtotal` and `tax`.

    Print the `total` variable!

    Hint

    To accomplish this, you’ll need to use the multiplication and addition operators. Remember to multiply the `subtotal` by `tax` first to calculate the tax amount, then add this to the `subtotal` to get the `total`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    There were 4 people who bought this meal together and want to split the cost.

    Create a `double` variable called `perPerson` that holds `total` divided by 4.

    Print the `perPerson` variable!

    Hint

    To calculate the amount each person has to pay, you’ll need to use the division operator `/`. Remember to assign the result of the division to the `perPerson` variable.

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### Modulo

3 min

If we baked 10 cookies and gave them out in batches of 3, how many would we have leftover after giving out all the full batches we could?

The modulo operator `%`, gives us the **remainder** after two numbers are divided.

```
int cookiesBaked = 10;int cookiesLeftover = 10 % 3;//cookiesLeftover holds 1
```

You have 1 cookie left after giving out all the batches of 3 you could!

Modulo can be a tricky concept, so let’s try another example.

Imagine we need to know whether a number is even or odd. An even number is divisible by 2.

Modulo can help! Dividing an even number by 2 will have a **remainder** of 0. Dividing an odd number by 2 will have a **remainder** of 1.

```
7 % 2// 1, odd!8 % 2// 0, even!9 % 2// 1, odd!
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    You are trying to split up students into groups of 3. How many students will be left out once the groups are made?

    Create a variable called `leftOut` that holds the modulo of `students` and 3. Then, print the variable!

    Hint

    To determine how many students will be left out after grouping, you’ll need to use the modulo operator `%`. This operator will give you the remainder of the division between the total number of students and the group size. So, `leftOut` should be calculated as the remainder of the division of `students` by 3.

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### Compound Assignment Operators

5 min

Sometimes, we need to adjust the value of a variable.

Imagine we’re working at a bake sale and want to keep track of how many cupcakes we have by creating a variable called `numCupcakes`:

```
int numCupcakes = 12;
```

If we baked `8` more cupcakes, we know that we could update our variable using the `+` operator:

```
numCupcakes = numCupcakes + 8; // Value is now 20
```

While this method works just fine, we had to write our variable `numCupcakes` twice. We can shorten this syntax by using a _compound assignment operator_.

Compound assignment

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[operators](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/operators)

perform an arithmetic operation on a variable and then reassigns its value. Using the `+=` compound assignment operator, we can rewrite our previous code like so:

```
numCupcakes += 8; // Value is now 20
```

Now we only need to reference `numCupcakes` once.

We can use compound assignment operators for all of the arithmetic operators we’ve covered:

-   Addition (`+=`)
-   Subtraction (`-=`)
-   Multiplication (`*=`)
-   Division (`/=`)
-   Modulo (`%=`)

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    You are also in charge of keeping track of how many cookies there are at the bake sale. This value is represented by the variable `numCookies`.

    A customer comes and buys `3` cookies. Use the appropriate compound assignment operator to reflect this change.

    Hint

    You should use the `-=` compound assignment operator.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Another customer buys half of the remaining cookies.

    Use the appropriate compound assignment operator to reflect this change.

    Hint

    Use the `/=` compound assignment operator to divide the value of `numCookies` by `2`.

### Order of Operations

4 min

If we were to place multiple

Preview: Docs Operators are used to perform various operations on variables and values of various data types.

[operators](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/operators)

in a single expression, what operation would the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[compiler](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/compiler)

evaluate first?

```
int num = 5 * (10 - 4) + 4 / 2;
```

The order of operations dictates the order in which an expression (like the one above) is evaluated. Operators that share the same precedence are evaluated from Left-to-Right within the expression.

The order is as follows:

1.  Parentheses
2.  Exponents
3.  Modulo/Multiplication/Division
4.  Addition/Subtraction

With this new information in mind, let’s dissect the expression from above so that we can find the value of `num`:

```
5 * (10 - 4) + 4 / 2
```

`10 - 4` would be evaluated first because it is wrapped in parentheses. This value would become `6` making our expression look like this:

```
5 * 6 + 4 / 2
```

Next, `5 * 6` will be evaluated because of the `*` operator. This value is `30`. Our expression now looks like this:

```
30 + 4 / 2
```

Following the order of operations, `4 / 2` will be evaluated next because the division operator `/` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`. Our expression now resembles the following:

```
30 + 2
```

`30 + 2` is `32`. This means that the value of `num` is `32`.

Instructions

Take a look at the expressions in **Operations.java**.

Solve for the value of each of the expressions on your own.

To find out if your calculations are right, uncomment the print statements and run the code.

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### Greater Than and Less Than

9 min

Now, we’re withdrawing money from our bank account program, and we want to see if we’re withdrawing less money than what we have available.

Java has _relational operators_ for numeric datatypes that make `boolean` comparisons. These include less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`), which help us solve our withdrawal problem.

```
double balance = 20000.01;double amountToWithdraw = 5000.01;System.out.print(amountToWithdraw < balance);//this will print true, since amountToWithdraw is less than balance
```

You can save the result of a comparison as a `boolean`, which you learned about in the last lesson.

```
double myBalance = 200.05;double costOfBuyingNewLaptop = 1000.05;boolean canBuyLaptop = myBalance > costOfBuyingNewLaptop;//canBuyLaptop is false, since 200.05 is not more than 1000.05
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Print the expression that checks if the amount of credits you have earned, `creditsEarned`, is greater than the number of credits you need to graduate, `creditsToGraduate`.

    Hint

    To accomplish this, you’ll need to use the greater than (`>`) relational operator to compare `creditsEarned` and `creditsToGraduate`. This will return a boolean value that you can then print out.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Create a variable called `creditsAfterSeminar` that holds the amount of credits earned after taking a seminar, which is worth `creditsOfSeminar` credits. `creditsAfterSeminar` should be the sum of `creditsEarned` and `creditsOfSeminar`.

    Print out whether `creditsToGraduate` is less than `creditsAfterSeminar`.

    Hint

    Use the addition operator (`+`) to add `creditsEarned` and `creditsOfSeminar` together. Then, use a relational operator to compare `creditsToGraduate` and `creditsAfterSeminar`.

### Equals and Not Equals

7 min

So how would we validate our paycheck to see if we got paid the right amount?

We can use another relational operator to do this. `==` will tell us if two

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/variables)

are equal:

```
double paycheckAmount = 620;double calculatedPaycheck = 15.50 * 40;System.out.print(paycheckAmount == calculatedPaycheck);// This will print true, since paycheckAmount equals calculatedPaycheck
```

Notice that the equality check is **two** equal signs, instead of one. One equal sign, `=`, is how we assign values to variables! It’s easy to mix these up, so make sure to check your code for the right number of equal signs.

To check if two variables are **not** equal, we can use `!=`:

```
double balance = 20000.0;double amountToDeposit = 620;double updatedBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;boolean balanceHasChanged = balance != updatedBalance;// balanceHasChanged holds true, since balance does not equal updatedBalance
```

    To see if these are the same album, you’re going to compare the number of songs on each one, and the total length of the albums.

    First, create a variable called `sameNumberOfSongs` that stores whether the two albums have the same number of songs.

    Hint

    To compare the number of songs on each, you could use:

    ```
    songsA == songsB
    ```

    To print this expression, put it inside `System.out.println()`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Now, create a variable called `differentLength` that stores the result of checking whether the two album lengths are **not** the same.

    Hint

    To accomplish this, you’ll want to use the `!=` operator to compare the lengths of the two albums. This operator will return `true` if the lengths are not the same, and `false` otherwise.

    Create a `double` variable called `totalRecommendedAmount` and set it to the product of the recommended water intake (`recommendedWaterIntake`) and the amount of days in the challenge (`daysInChallenge`).

    Hint

    To create the `totalRecommendedAmount` variable, you’ll need to use the multiplication operator `*` in Java. This will allow you to multiply the `recommendedWaterIntake` by `daysInChallenge` and store the result in your new variable.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Create a `boolean` variable called `isChallengeComplete` and set it to the result of checking if your intake, `yourWaterIntake`, is at least as much as the `totalRecommendedAmount`.

    Then, print the `isChallengeComplete` variable.

    Hint

    To create the boolean variable `isChallengeComplete`, you’ll want to use a comparison operator to compare `yourWaterIntake` with `totalRecommendedAmount`. Remember, a boolean variable can only hold two values: `true` or `false`.

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### .equals()

4 min

So far, we’ve only been using operations on primitive types. It doesn’t make much sense to multiply `String`s, or see if one `String` is less than the other. But what if we had two users logging into a site, and we wanted to see if their usernames were the same?

With objects, such as `String`s, we can’t use the primitive equality operator. To test equality with objects, we use a built-in method called `.equals()`. When comparing objects, make sure to always use `.equals()`. `==` will work occasionally, but the reason why it sometimes works has to do with how objects are stored in memory.

For the purposes of this lesson (as well as good practice) remember to use `.equals()` instead of `==` when comparing objects.

To use it, we call it on one `String`, by using `.`, and pass in the `String` to compare against in parentheses:

```
String person1 = "Paul";String person2 = "John";String person3 = "Paul";System.out.println(person1.equals(person2));// Prints false, since "Paul" is not "John"System.out.println(person1.equals(person3));// Prints true, since "Paul" is "Paul"

    To check if `line2` and `line3` are equal, you’ll need to use the `.equals()` method, similar to how we compared `line1` and `line2`. Remember to call this method on `line2` and pass `line3` as the argument.

# Learn Java: Manipulating Variables: String Concatenation

## Narrative and Instructions

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### String Concatenation

8 min

We have covered a lot of built-in functionality in Java throughout this lesson. We’ve seen `+`, `-`, `<`, `==`, and many other operators. Most of these only work on primitives, but some work on `String`s too!

Let’s say we want to print out a variable, and we want to describe it as we print it out. For our bank account example, imagine we want to tell the user:

```
Your username is: <username>
```

With the value of the variable `username` displayed.

The `+` operator, which we used for adding numbers together, can be used to _concatenate_ `String`s. In other words, we can use it to join two `String`s together!

```
String username = "PrinceNelson";System.out.println("Your username is: " + username);
```

This code will print:

```
Your username is: PrinceNelson
```

We can even use a primitive datatype as the second variable to concatenate, and Java will intelligently make it a `String` first:

```
int balance = 10000;String message = "Your balance is: " + balance;System.out.println(message);
```

This code will print:

```
Your balance is: 10000
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    In our zoo, we have a certain number of animals, stored in `animals`, of a certain species, stored in `species`.

    Use `+` to make a new `String` variable called `zooDescription`. It should hold a String that looks like:

    ```
    Our zoo has <animals> <species>s!
    ```

    For example, if we had `5` animals that were all of the species `Masai Giraffe`, the String would say:

    ```
    Our zoo has 5 Masai Giraffes!
    ```

    Hint

    You will need to add the String `"Our zoo has "`, the variable `animals`, an extra space `" "`, the variable `species`, and the string `"s!"`:

    ```
    "Our zoo has " + animals + " " + species + "s!"
    ```

    Store this result in the variable `zooDescription`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Print out the variable `zooDescription`!

    Hint

    To print out the variable `zooDescription`, you can use the `System.out.println()` method in Java. You just need to pass `zooDescription` as the argument to this method.

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### final Keyword

3 min

Throughout this lesson, we’ve discussed the different ways we can manipulate a variable; however, what do we do with a variable that should never change its value?

For example, the year we were born will always stay the same. There’s no way we can change that information. A value like this in our code should be unchangeable.

To declare a variable with a value that cannot be manipulated, we need to use the `final` keyword. To use the `final` keyword, prepend `final` to a variable declaration like so:

```
final int yearBorn = 1968;
```

When we declare a variable using `final`, the value cannot be changed; any attempts at doing so will cause an error to occur:

```error
error: cannot assign a value to final variable yearBorn
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Create an unchangeable `double` variable called `pi` and set its value to `3.14`.

    Print the value of `pi`.

    Hint

    Add the `final` keyword to the variable declaration to ensure the value cannot be changed.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    On a new line, try to change the value of `pi`.

    What happens when the program is run?

    Hint

    When you run the code after manipulating the value of `pi`, the program should return an error similar to the following:

    ```error
    error: cannot assign a value to final variable pi
    ```

Learn Java: Manipulating Variables

### Review

9 min

What’s the use of having variables if you can’t do anything with them? We’ve now seen some ways you can operate on variables and compare them. The possibilities are endless!

We covered:

-   Addition and subtraction, using `+` and `-`
-   Multiplication and division, using `*` and `/`
-   The modulo operator for finding remainders, `%`
-   Compound assignment operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.
-   The order of operations: parentheses -> exponents -> multiplication, division, modulo -> addition, subtraction
-   Greater than, `>`, and less than, `<`
-   Equal to, `==`, and not equal to, `!=`
-   Greater than or equal to, `>=`, and less than or equal to, `<=`
-   `equals()` for comparing `String`s and other objects
-   Using `+` to concatenate `String`s
-   The `final` keyword which makes variables unchangeable

Practice some of these concepts here, to make sure you have a solid foundation for learning more complicated and exciting Java concepts!

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    To review, let’s try building some of the bank account functionality we talked about throughout the lesson.

    First, create a new `double` variable called `updatedBalance`, and store `balance` with `amountToWithdraw` subtracted from it.

    Hint

    Use the subtraction operator `-` to subtract `amountToWithdraw` from `balance`. Then, you can store this result in the new `double` variable `updatedBalance`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Now, you’ve decided to split your balance evenly 3 ways and give it to your three best friends.

    Create a `double` variable called `amountForEachFriend` that holds your updated balance divided by `3`.

    Hint

    Use the division operator `/`. Remember to ensure that you’re using the `updatedBalance` variable you’ve just calculated in the previous step.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Your friends each want to buy a concert ticket with the money you’ve given them. The tickets cost `250`!

    Create a `boolean` called `canPurchaseTicket` and set it equal to whether or not `amountForEachFriend` is at least enough to purchase a concert ticket.

    Then, use `System.out.println()` to print `canPurchaseTicket`.

    Hint

    You can use `>=` to create this boolean:

    ```
    boolean somethingIsAtLeast50 = something >= 50;
    ```

    This will be `true` if `something` is at least `50`, and `false` otherwise.

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    How much money did you give your friends, anyway?

    Use `+` and `System.out.println()` to print out:

    ```
    I gave each friend <amountForEachFriend>...
    ```

    with the value of `amountForEachFriend` where `<amountForEachFriend>` is.

    Hint

    Remember that you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings in Java. In this case, you’ll want to concatenate the string `"I gave each friend "` with the value of `amountForEachFriend` to create the full sentence.
