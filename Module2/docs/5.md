# Casting and Converting

Learn how to transform a value of one data type to another in Java.

If you aren’t familiar with the folk tale _The Little Glass Slipper_, a magical entity casts a spell that transforms the protagonist’s clothing type from work attire to formal wear. As programmers, we can do something similar by transforming a value of one primitive data type to another using **type casting**.

### Numerical-Based Casting

When we use casting to change the data type of number-based values, it can impact how much data the value holds. If there is less data in the value after casting, it’s considered _narrow type casting_. If the value contains more data after casting, it’s classified as _widening type casting_.

In order to cast, we need to use a _casting operator_ to alert the compiler that we want to create a temporary value that is a converted data type. Two casting operators we will focus on are `(int)` and `(double)`.

#### Narrow Type Casting

To convert a `double` to an `int`, we would place the casting operator `(int)` in front of a value we would like to convert.

For example:

```
double numDouble = 12.99;System.out.println("Double value: " + numDouble);// convert a double to intint numInt = (int) numDouble;System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);
```

This would output:

```
Double value: 12.99Int value: 12
```

When we convert a `double` to an `int`, the digits to the right of the decimal point are truncated. Of course, when we see a value like `12.99`, we know that it’s numerically closer in value to `13` than it is to `12`. Java does not automatically round the value. If we want to round our positive value to the nearest integer, we can use `(int)(value + 0.5)`; in the case that our number is negative, we would instead use `(int)(x - 0.5)`:

```
double numDouble = 12.99;System.out.println("Double value: " + numDouble);// convert a double to an int rounded to nearest valueint numInt = (int) (numDouble + 0.5);System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);
```

This would output:

```
Double value: 12.99Int value: 13
```

It’s important to be aware that there are limitations to when working with whole number, or `int`, values in Java. There is a limited amount of data that can be stored in an `int` — 4 bytes. We can use `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to find the minimum and maximum value of an `int`:

```
System.out.println("Min: " + Integer.MIN_VALUE); // Prints: Min: -2147483648System.out.println("Max: " + Integer.MAX_VALUE); // Prints: Max: 2147483647
```

If we created an expression that evaluated a value outside of this range, we would be faced with an integer overflow, which could result in an error or having an incorrect value that’s within the allowed range.

Coding question

## Questions

Try outputting these `int` values that exist outside the appropriate range. When you run the program, consider the following questions:

-   Which variable causes an error?
-   Which variable outputs an incorrect value?

You will need to comment out the variable that is causing an error in order to see the variable with the incorrect value.

#### Widening Type Casting

If we were to use casting to change an `int` value to a `double`, we’d need to implement the `(double)` casting operator in our code:

```
int numInt = 9;System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);// convert an int to a doubleSystem.out.println("Double value: " + (double)numInt);
```

This will output:

```
Int value: 9Double value: 9.0
```

In the program above, we did not change the type of `numInt` in the second print statement; instead, we created a temporary value when we casted `numInt` as a `double`. If we wanted to permanently save that value, we could create a new variable like `double newValue = (double)numInt`.

Unlike in narrow type casting, an `int` value can _automatically_ get cast to a `double` value in Java code. For example, this occurrence can happen when we create an arithmetic expression that references a `double` and an `int`:

```
System.out.println(100.0 / 5); // Prints: 20.0
```

Java automatically cast the value as a `double` even though one of the values in the expression was an `int`.

We can also cast the value of an expression as a double even if both values in the expression are `int`s. To do this, we’ll place `(double)` in front of an expression that is contained in its own set of parentheses like so:

```
System.out.println((double)(100 / 5)); // Prints: 20.0
```

## Questions

Does the following code show narrow type casting or widening type casting?

### Code

```
System.out.println((double)(13 * 5));
```

## Answer Choices

Narrow type casting

(Selected)Correct:

Widening type casting

👏

Correct! We convert the value of `13 * 5` from an `int` value to a `double` value using the `(double)` casting operator.

### Converting Integer and String Values

In Java, we can convert an `int` value to a `String` value and vice versa. This doesn’t count as casting because a `String` is not a primitive type value, but it can be useful to know how to perform this conversion. To change the value of an `int` into a `String`, we need to use the `valueOf()` method from the `String` class:

```
int numInt = 15;System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);// Convert int value to StringString numString = String.valueOf(numInt);System.out.println("String value: " + numString);
```

This will output:

```
Int value: 15String value: 15
```

Even though the output looks the same, the second output shows us a `String` value instead of an `int` value.

If we wanted to turn a `String` value into an `int`, we would need to call the `parseInt()` method from the `Integer` class. In order to call this method, we will reference the class `Integer` and then call the method `parseInt()` by using the dot operator (`.`). Altogether, this call would look like this `Integer.parseInt(argumentValue)`.

Let’s see this in action by converting the `String` value `"12"` into an `int`:

```
String numString = "12";// convert String to intint numInt = Integer.parseInt(numString);System.out.println("The int value: " + numInt); // Prints: The int value: 12// we can now use the value like any other int numInt++;System.out.println(numInt); // Prints: 13
```

Note that the value in the `String` MUST contain a numerical value in order to convert it into an `int`. If we tried to run the code `Integer.parseInt(“hello”);`, we would receive an error.

### Conclusions

Great job reaching the end of this article. Let’s go over what we learned:

-   Casting is the process of converting a value of one primitive data type to another.
-   Narrow type casting occurs when the amount of data held a value decreases after conversion.
-   To convert a `double` into an `int`, we must use the `(int)` casting operator.
-   Narrow type casting does not automatically occur in Java and must be done manually by the programmer.
-   Widening type casting occurs when a value increases how much data it holds after casting.
-   To convert an `int` to a `double`, we need to use the `(double)` casting operator.
-   Widening type casting can occur automatically in Java. `String` values can be converted to an `int` using the `parseInt()` method from the `Integer` class.
-   An `int` value can be converted into a `String` using the `valueOf()` method from the `String` class.
