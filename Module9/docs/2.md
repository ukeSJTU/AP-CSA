# Quiz: Learn Java: Loops

## Question 1

How can you modify this code so that it won’t cause an infinite `while` loop?

### Code

```java
int i = 7;
while (i > 0) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Answer

Add `i--` inside the `while` loop.

Explanation: Decrementing `i` ensures that the condition `i > 0` will eventually become `false`, preventing an infinite loop.

## Question 2

How many times will `"Hello, I.T. Have you tried turning it off and on again?"` be printed to the console?

### Code

```java
int i = 1;
while (i < 100) {
  System.out.println("Hello, I.T. Have you tried turning it off and on again?");
  i++;
}
```

### Answer

99

Explanation: This would print 100 times if the condition were `i <= 100` or if `i` were initialized to `0`. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches 100, it prints 99 times.

## Question 3

Rebuild the `while` loop as a `for` loop.

### Code

```java
int i = 99;
while (i > 0) {
  System.out.println(i + " bottles of soda on the wall.");
  i--;
}
// Rebuild here:
for (int j = 99; j > 0; j--) {
  System.out.println(j + " bottles of soda on the wall.");
}
```

### Answer

The provided `for` loop is correct.

## Question 4

Complete the `for` loop so that it won’t cause an infinite loop.

### Code

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Answer

The loop is already correctly structured with `i++` to prevent an infinite loop.

## Question 5

Complete the for-each loop.

### Code

```java
for (String llama : llamas) {
  sayHello(llama);
}
```

### Answer

The syntax is correct, using `:` to indicate iteration over the collection `llamas`.

## Question 6

When would it be helpful to use a `for` loop instead of a for-each loop when iterating over an `ArrayList` of items?

### Answer

When you aren’t starting from the beginning of the `ArrayList`.

Explanation: It can also be helpful when you need to know the index of each item, which a for-each loop does not provide.
