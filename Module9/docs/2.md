## Questions

How many times will `"Hello, I.T. Have you tried turning it off and on again?"` be printed to the console?

### Code

```
int i = 1;while (i < 100) {    System.out.println("Hello, I.T. Have you tried turning it off and on again?");    i++;  }
```

## Answer Choices

-   100
-   It will continue printing until the program crashes because of an infinite loop.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    99

    👏

    This would print 100 times if the condition were `i <= 100` or if `i` were initialized to `0`.

-   An unknown number of times.

## Questions

When would it be helpful to use a `for` loop instead of a for-each loop when iterating over an `ArrayList` of items?

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    When you aren’t starting from the beginning of the `ArrayList`.

    👏

    It can also be helpful when you need to know the index of each item.

-   When you’re worried about causing an infinite loop.
-   When each item in the `ArrayList` has a different value.
-   When you don’t know how long the `ArrayList` will be.
