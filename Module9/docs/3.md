# Fizz Buzz

## Project Brief

### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

### Description

Fizz Buzz is a common developer interview question designed to test creative problem-solving skills in coding. The challenge is to write a program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100 with specific replacements:

-   For multiples of 3, print `Fizz` instead of the number.
-   For multiples of 5, print `Buzz`.
-   For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.

Example output pattern:

```plaintext
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
FizzBuzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...
97
98
Fizz
Buzz
```

## What You'll Be Building

As the inventor of this challenge, Imran Ghory, states:

> After a fair bit of trial and error I’ve come to discover that people who struggle to code don’t just struggle on big problems, or even smallish problems (i.e. write an implementation of a linked list). They struggle with tiny problems.
>
> So I set out to develop questions that can identify this kind of developer and came up with a class of questions I call “FizzBuzz Questions” named after a game children often play (or are made to play) in schools in the UK.

## Tasks

### Setting Up

1. Start by creating a skeleton for the program:

    - Create a `FizzBuzz` class.
    - Inside `FizzBuzz`, build an empty `main()` method.

    > Hint

    > ```java
    > class FizzBuzz {
    >   public static void main(String[] args) {
    >     // You'll add code here
    >   }
    > }
    > ```

### Outputting Numbers from 1 to 100

2. Write a `for` loop that starts at 1 and iterates to 100 to output all numbers from 1 to 100.

    > Hint
    >
    > ```java
    > for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    >   // You'll write loop body here
    > }
    > ```

3. Inside the `for` loop, output the counter `i`.

    > Hint
    > Your code should look like:
    >
    > ```java
    > for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    >   System.out.println(i);
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > The output should look like this:
    >
    > ```plaintext
    > 1
    > 2
    > 3
    > 4
    > 5
    > ...
    > 100
    > ```

4. Ensure your code prints every number between 1 and 100.

### Implementing Fizz Buzz Logic

5. Implement the logic to replace numbers with `Fizz`, `Buzz`, or `FizzBuzz` based on divisibility by 3 and 5. Use `if`/`else if`/`else` statements for the different conditions.

    > Hint
    > You’ll need the modulo `%` operator: if `i` is a multiple of 3, then the condition `i % 3 == 0` will be `true`. Try to solve this independently to simulate a job interview situation.
