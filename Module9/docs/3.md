# Fizz Buzz

## Project Brief

### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

### Fizz Buzz

[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a common developer interview question; so common it’s almost cliché!

The challenge is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve coding problems.

Want to give it a shot?

![Numbers replaced with Fizz and Buzz as appropriate.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-Java/fizzbuzz.png "Fizz Buzz")

Write a **FizzBuzz.java** program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100… with a catch:

-   For multiples of 3, print `Fizz` instead of the number.
-   For the multiples of 5, print `Buzz`.
-   For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.

```

## What You'll Be Building

1.

As the inventor of this challenge, Imran Ghory, states:

> “After a fair bit of trial and error I’ve come to discover that people who struggle to code don’t just struggle on big problems, or even smallish problems (i.e. write an implementation of a linked list). They struggle with tiny problems.
>
> So I set out to develop questions that can identify this kind of developer and came up with a class of questions I call “FizzBuzz Questions” named after a game children often play (or are made to play) in schools in the UK.”

## Setting Up

2.

Start by creating a skeleton for the program:

-   Create a `FizzBuzz` class.
-   Inside `FizzBuzz`, build an empty `main()` method.

Hint

```
class FizzBuzz {    public static void main(String[] args) {                // You'll add code here    }}
```

## Outputting Numbers from 1 to 100

3.

How do we output all the numbers from 1 to 100?

Well, we could write `System.out.println()` 100 times back to back, but that’s no fun. What else can we do?

That’s right! A `for` loop!

Write a `for` loop that starts at 1 and iterates to 100.

Hint

```
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {  // You'll write loop body here}
```

4.

Inside the `for` loop, output the counter `i`.

Hint

Your code should look like:

```
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {  System.out.println(i);}
```

The output should look like this:

```
12345...100
```

5.

Run your code — does it print every number between 1 and 100?

```
java FizzBuzz
```

Hint

If nothing happens when you run your code, try compiling to see if you have a typo somewhere:

```
javac FizzBuzz.java
```

6.

Now that we have all the numbers, let’s solve the hard part.

Before coding further, take out a piece of paper and brainstorm.

How do we check whether or not a number is divisible by 3? What about for the other two conditions?

When you are ready, try to implement a solution.

Hint

You will need a `if`/`else if`/`else` statement for the different conditions.

You’ll also need the modulo `%` operator: if `i` is a multiple of 3, then the condition `i % 3 == 0` will be `true`.

It’s not a true test of your abilities if you look at other people’s answers or search for examples — try to solve this yourself as if you were in a job interview situation.
