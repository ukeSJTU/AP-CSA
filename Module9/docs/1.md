### Introduction to Loops

In the programming world, we hate repeating ourselves. There are two reasons for this:

-   Writing the same code over and over is time-consuming.
-   Having less code means having less to debug.

But we often need to do the same task more than once. Fortunately, computers are really good (and fast) at doing repetitive tasks. And in Java, we can use loops.

A

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[_loop_](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/loops?page_ref=catalog)

is a programming tool that allows developers to repeat the same block of code until some condition is met.

First, a starting condition is evaluated. If the starting condition is `true`, then the loop body is executed. When the last line of the loop body is executed, the condition is _re-evaluated_. This process continues until the condition is `false` (if the condition never becomes `false`, we can actually end up with an **infinite loop**!). If the starting condition is `false`, the loop never gets executed.

We employ loops to easily scale programs - saving time and minimizing mistakes.

We’ll go over three types of loops that we’ll see everywhere:

-   `while` loops
-   `for` loops
-   `for-each` loops

### While We're Here

9 min

A `while` loop looks a bit like an `if` statement:

```
while (silliness > 10) {  // code to run}
```

Like an `if` statement, the code inside a `while` loop will only run if the condition is `true`. However, a `while` loop will continue running the code over and over until the condition evaluates to `false`. So the code block will repeat until `silliness` is less than or equal to 10.

```
// set attempts to 0int attempts = 0;// enter loop if condition is truewhile (passcode != 0524 && attempts < 4) {  System.out.println("Try again.");  passcode = getNewPasscode();  attempts += 1;  // is condition still true?  // if so, repeat code block}// exit when condition is not true
```

`while` loops are extremely useful when you want to run some code until a specific change happens. However, if you aren’t certain that change will occur, beware the infinite loop!

_Infinite loops_ occur when the condition will never evaluate to `false`. This can cause your entire program to crash.

```
int hedgehogs = 5;// This will cause an infinite loop:while (hedgehogs < 6) {  System.out.println("Not enough hedgehogs!");}
```

In the example above, `hedgehogs` remains equal to `5`, which is less than `6`. So we would get an infinite loop.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Take a look at **LuckyFive.java**. We’ve set up a random number generator that allows you to simulate the roll of a die.

    Create a `while` loop that will continue to loop while `dieRoll` is NOT `5`.

    **Do NOT run your code yet** — you will get an infinite loop here because the value of `dieRoll` is never changed.

    ***

    Inside the loop, reset `dieRoll` with a new random value between `1` and `6`.

    Now you can run the code.

    Hint

    To repeat code while the value of `x` is not equal to `3`:

    ```
    while (x != 3) {  // code goes here}
    ```

    To reset `dieRoll` to a new number between `1` and `6`:

    ```
    dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the `while` loop, above the line where you reset `dieRoll`, print out `dieRoll` to the terminal.

    Hint

    To print out `dieRoll` to the terminal, you can use the `System.out.println()` function. Place this line of code before you reset `dieRoll` within your `while` loop.

Learn Java: Loops

### Incrementing While Loops

7 min

When looping through code, it’s common to use a counter variable. A _counter_ (also known as an _iterator_) is a variable used in the conditional logic of the loop and (usually) incremented in value during each iteration through the code. For example:

```
// counter is initializedint wishes = 0;// conditional logic uses counterwhile (wishes < 3) {  System.out.println("Wish granted.");  // counter is incremented  wishes++;}
```

In the above example, the counter `wishes` gets initialized before the loop with a value of `0`, then the program will keep printing `"Wish granted."` and adding `1` to `wishes` as long as `wishes` has a value of less than `3`. Once `wishes` reaches a value of `3` or more, the program will exit the loop.

So the output would look like:

```
Wish granted.Wish granted.Wish granted.
```

We can also decrement counters like this:

```
int pushupsToDo = 10;while (pushupsToDo > 0) {  doPushup();  pushupsToDo--;}
```

In the code above, the counter, `pushupsToDo`, starts at 10, and increments down one at a time. When it hits 0, the loop exits.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    In **Coffee.java**, initialize an `int` variable called `cupsOfCoffee` with a value of `1`.

    Hint

    For example, to initialize `eyes` with a value of `2`:

    ```
    int eyes = 2;
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Create a `while` loop that runs as long as `cupsOfCoffee` is less than or equal to `100`.

    **Important:** Inside the `while` loop, increment `cupsOfCoffee` by `1` to prevent an infinite loop.

    Hint

    To run a `while` loop as long as `kittens` is less than or equal to `6` with `kittens` incrementing on each iteration:

    ```
    while (kittens <= 6) {  kittens++;}
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Inside the `while` loop above where you incremented `cupsOfCoffee` print the following:

    ```
    Fry drinks cup of coffee #1
    ```

    The `1` in this statement should correspond with the current value of `cupsOfCoffee`. When `cupsOfCoffee` is `100`, this should be printed:

    ```
    Fry drinks cup of coffee #100
    ```

    Hint

    To print a `String` with a variable value:

    ```
    System.out.println("I have " + kittens + " kittens");
    ```

Learn Java: Loops

### For Loops

2 min

Incrementing with loops is actually so common in programming that Java (like many other programming languages) includes syntax specifically to address this pattern: `for` loops.

A `for` _loop_ header is made up of the following three parts, each separated by a semicolon:

1.  The initialization of the loop control variable.
2.  A

    Preview: Docs Loading link description

    [`boolean`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/boolean)

    expression.

3.  An increment or decrement statement.

The opening line might look like this:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  // code that will run}
```

In a `for` loop, an initialization statement is run once in order to initialize the loop control variable. This variable is modified in every iteration, can be referenced in the loop body, and used to test the boolean condition. In the example above, `i` is the loop control variable.

Let’s breakdown the above example:

1.  `i = 0`: `i` is initialized to `0`
2.  `i < 5`: the loop is given a `boolean` condition that relies on the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute until `i < 5` is `false`.
3.  `i++`: `i` will increment at the end of each loop and before the condition is re-evaluated.

So the code will run through the loop a total of five times.

We’ll also hear the term “iteration” in reference to loops. When we _iterate_, it just means that we are repeating the same block of code.

### Using For Loops

6 min

Even though we can write `while` loops that accomplish the same task, `for` loops are useful because they help us remember to increment our counter — something that is easy to forget when we increment with a `while` loop.

Leaving out that line of code would cause an infinite loop — yikes!

Fortunately, equipped with our new understanding of `for` loops, we can help prevent infinite loops in our own code.

It’s important to be aware that, if we don’t create the correct `for` loop header, we can cause the iteration to loop one too many or one too few times; this occurrence is known as an “off by one” error.

For example, imagine we wanted to find the sum of the first ten numbers and wrote the following code:

```
int sum = 0;for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  sum += i}
```

This code would produce an incorrect value of `45`. We skipped adding `10` to `sum` because our loop control variable started with a value of `0` and stopped the iteration after it had a value of `9`. We were off by one! We could fix this by changing the condition of our loop to be `i <= 10;` or `i < 11;`.

These errors can be tricky because, while they do not always produce an error in the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[terminal](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/terminal)

, they can cause some miscalculations in our code. These are called logical errors — the code runs fine, but it didn’t do what you expected it to do.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    We’ve provided a `while` loop that loops from `1` to `100` outputting a string on each iteration. Refactor (rewrite) this code as a `for` loop.

    Remember, the syntax of a `for` loop looks like:

    ```
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  // code that will run}
    ```

    Hint

    To refactor the `while` loop into a `for` loop, you’ll need to initialize your loop control variable, set a condition for the loop to continue, and increment the loop control variable all within the `for` loop header. Think about how the `while` loop is structured and how you can translate that into a `for` loop structure.

### Iterating Over Arrays and ArrayLists

11 min

One common pattern we’ll encounter as a programmer is _traversing_, or looping, through a list of data and doing something with each item. In Java, that list would be an

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/arrays?page_ref=catalog)

or

Preview: Docs The ArrayList class uses dynamic arrays for storing elements. Conceptually, it is like an array but with no size limit.

[`ArrayList`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/array-list?page_ref=catalog)

and the loop could be a `for` loop. But wait, how does this work?

In order to traverse an array or `ArrayList` using a loop, we must find a way to access each element via its

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

. We may recall that `for` loops are created with a counter variable. We can use that counter to track the index of the current element as we iterate over the list of data.

Because the first index in an array or `ArrayList` is `0`, the counter would begin with a value of `0` and increment until the end of the list. So we can increment through the array or `ArrayList` using its indices.

For example, if we wanted to add `1` to every `int` item in an array `secretCode`, we could do this:

```
for (int i = 0; i < secretCode.length; i++) {  // Increase value of element value by 1  secretCode[i] += 1;}
```

Notice that our condition in this example is `i < secretCode.length`. Because array indices start at 0, the length of `secretCode` is 1 larger than its final index. A loop should stop its traversal before its counter variable is equal to the length of the list.

To give a concrete example, if the length of an array is `5`, the last index we want to access is `4`. If we were to try to access index `5`, we would get an

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/arrayindexoutofboundsexception?page_ref=catalog)

error! This is a very common mistake when first starting to traverse arrays.

Traversing an `ArrayList` looks very similar:

```
for (int i = 0; i < secretCode.size(); i++) {  // Increase value of element value by 1  int num = secretCode.get(i);  secretCode.set(i, num + 1);}
```

We can also use `while` loops to traverse through arrays and `ArrayList`s. If we use a `while` loop, we need to create our own counter variable to access individual elements. We’ll also set our condition to continue looping until our counter variable equals the list length.

For example, let’s use a `while` loop to traverse through an array:

```
int i = 0; // initialize counterwhile (i < secretCode.length) {  secretCode[i] += 1;  i++; // increment the while loop}
```

Traversing through an `ArrayList` with a `while` loop would look like this:

```
int i = 0; // initialize counterwhile (i < secretCode.size()) {  int num = secretCode.get(i);  secretCode.set(i, num + 1);  i++; // increment the while loop}
```

    Let’s use a `for` loop to iterate over `expenses` and sum up the `total` of all items.

    Start with the skeleton of a `for` loop:

    -   The loop should run while `i` is less than the `size()` of `expenses`.
    -   Increment `i`.

### break and continue

9 min

If we ever want to exit a loop before it finishes all its iterations or want to skip one of the iterations, we can use the `break` and `continue` keywords.

The `break` keyword is used to exit, or break, a loop. Once `break` is executed, the loop will stop iterating. For example:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  System.out.println(i);  if (i == 4) {    break;  }}
```

Even though the loop was set to iterate until the condition `i < 10` is `false`, the above code will output the following because we used `break`:

```
01234
```

The `continue` keyword can be placed inside of a loop if we want to skip an iteration. If `continue` is executed, the current loop iteration will immediately end, and the next iteration will begin. We can use the `continue` keyword to skip any even valued iteration:

```
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {  if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) {    continue;  }  System.out.println(numbers[i]);}
```

This program would output the following:

```
135
```

In this case, if a number is even, we hit a `continue` statement, which skips the rest of that iteration, so the print statement is skipped. As a result, we only see odd numbers print.

For example, we have a method called `checkForJacket()` that takes in an

s. If any of the elements are equivalent to the `String` value `"jacket"`, the method will return `true`:

```
public static boolean checkForJacket(String[] lst) {  for (int i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {    System.out.println(lst[i]);    if (lst[i] == "jacket") {      return true;    }  }  return false;} public static void main(String[] args) {  String[] suitcase = {"shirt", "jacket", "pants", "socks"};     System.out.println(checkForJacket(suitcase));}
```

As soon as an element equals `"jacket"`, `return true;` is executed. This causes the loop to stop and the compiler to exit `checkForJacket()`. Running this code would output the following:

```
shirtjackettrue
```

### For-Each Loops

9 min

Sometimes we need access to the elements’ indices or we only want to iterate through a portion of a list. If that’s the case, a regular `for` loop or `while` loop is a great choice.

For example, we can use a `for` loop to print out each element in an

Preview: Docs Stores elements of various data types in an ordered collection.

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

called `inventoryItems`:

```
for (int inventoryItem = 0; inventoryItem < inventoryItems.length; inventoryItem++) {  // Print element at current index  System.out.println(inventoryItems[inventoryItem]);}
```

But sometimes we couldn’t care less about the indices; we only care about the element itself.

At times like this, for-each loops come in handy.

_For-each loops_, which are also referred to as _enhanced loops_, allow us to directly loop through each item in a list of items (like an array or `ArrayList`) and perform some action with each item.

If we want to use a for-each loop to rewrite our program above, the syntax looks like this:

```
for (String inventoryItem : inventoryItems) {  // Print element value  System.out.println(inventoryItem);}
```

Our enhanced loop contains two items: an enhanced `for` loop variable (`inventoryItem`) and a list to traverse through (`inventoryItems`).

We can read the `:` as “in” like this: for each `inventoryItem` (which should be a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[`String`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

) in `inventoryItems`, print `inventoryItem`.

If we try to assign a new value to the enhanced `for` loop variable, the value stored in the array or `ArrayList` will not change. This is because, for every iteration in the enhanced loop, the loop variable is assigned a copy of the list element.

**Note:** We can name the enhanced `for` loop variable whatever we want; using the singular of a plural is just a convention. We may also encounter conventions like `String word : sentence`.

### Removing Elements During Traversal

14 min

If we want to remove elements from an `ArrayList` while traversing through one, we can easily run into an error if we aren’t careful.

When an element is removed from an `ArrayList`, all the items that appear after the removed element will have their

value shift by negative one — it’s like all elements shifted to the left! We’ll have to be very careful with how we use our counter variable to avoid skipping elements.

##### Removing An Element Using `while`

When using a `while` loop and removing elements from an `ArrayList`, we should **not** increment the `while` loop’s counter whenever we remove an element. We don’t need to increase the counter because all of the other elements have now shifted to the left.

For example, if we removed the element at index `3`, then the element that was at index `4` will be moved to index `3`. If we increase our counter to `4`, we’ll skip that element!

Take a look at this block of code that will remove all odd numbers from an `ArrayList`. Think about what the value of `i` is, when we’re increasing the value of `i`, and when `i < lst.size()` becomes `False`.

```
int i = 0; // initialize counterwhile (i < lst.size()) {  // if value is odd, remove value  if (lst.get(i) % 2 != 0){    lst.remove(i);  } else {    // if value is even, increment counter    i++;  }}
```

##### Removing An Element Using `for`

We can use a similar strategy when removing elements using a `for` loop. When using a `while` loop, we decided to not increase our loop control variable whenever we removed an element. This ensured that we would not skip an element when all of the other elements shifted to the left.

When using a `for` loop, we, unfortunately, _must_ increase our loop control variable — the loop control variable will always change when we reach the end of the loop (and it will usually change by `1` because we often use something like `i++`.) Since we can’t avoid increasing our loop control variable, we can take matters into our own hands and decrease the loop control variable whenever we remove an item.

For example:

```
for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {  if (lst.get(i) == "value to remove"){    // remove value from ArrayList    lst.remove(lst.get(i));    // Decrease loop control variable by 1    i--;      }}
```

Now whenever we remove an item, we’ll decrease `i` by `1`. Then when we reach the end of the loop, `i` will increase by `1`. It will be like `i` never changed!

**Note:** Avoid manipulating the size of an `ArrayList` when using an enhanced `for` loop. Actions like adding or removing elements from an `ArrayList` when using a `for each` loop can cause a `ConcurrentModificationException` error.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Take a look at the code placed in the `main()` method of the `Lunch` class.

    Inside the method `removeAnts()`, use a `for` loop or a `while` loop to iterate through `lunchBox` and remove any element that has the value `"ant"`.

    Outside the loop, return the value of `lunchBox`.

    Hint

    The final solution should look similar to the code below if using a `for` loop:

    ```
    for (int i = 0; i < listName.size(); i++) {  if (listName.get(i) == "ant"){    listName.remove(listName.get(i));    i--;       }}return listName;
    ```

    If using a `while` loop, the solution may look similar to the following snippet:

    ```
    int i = 0; while (i < listName.size()) {  if (listName.get(i) == "ant"){    listName.remove(listName.get(i));  } else {    i++;  }}
    ```

Nice work! Let’s iterate over what you’ve just learned about loops:

-   `while` loops: These are useful to repeat a code block an unknown number of times until some condition is met. For example:

```
int wishes = 0;while (wishes < 3) {  // code that will run  wishes++;}
```

-   `for` loops: These are ideal for when you are incrementing or decrementing with a counter variable. For example:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  // code that will run}
```

-   For-each loops: These make it simple to do something with each item in a list. For example:

```
for (String inventoryItem : inventoryItems) {  // do something with each inventoryItem}
```

Instructions

Feel free to play around with loops, arrays, and `ArrayLists` in the code editor.
