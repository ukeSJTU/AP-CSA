# Learn Java: Loops

## Introduction to Loops

In the programming world, repeating code is inefficient for two reasons:

-   Writing the same code multiple times is time-consuming.
-   Having less code reduces the amount of debugging needed.

However, repetitive tasks are often necessary. Fortunately, computers excel at performing such tasks quickly. In Java, we use loops to achieve this.

A loop is a programming tool that repeats a block of code until a specific condition is met. Initially, a starting condition is evaluated. If the condition is `true`, the loop body executes. After the last line of the loop body is executed, the condition is re-evaluated. This process continues until the condition becomes `false`. If the condition never becomes `false`, an infinite loop occurs. If the starting condition is `false` from the beginning, the loop never executes.

Loops are employed to scale programs efficiently, saving time and minimizing errors. We’ll cover three types of loops commonly used:

-   `while` loops
-   `for` loops
-   `for-each` loops

## While We're Here

A `while` loop resembles an `if` statement:

```java
while (silliness > 10) {
  // code to run
}
```

Like an `if` statement, the code inside a `while` loop runs only if the condition is `true`. However, a `while` loop continues to execute the code repeatedly until the condition evaluates to `false`. So, the code block repeats until `silliness` is less than or equal to 10.

```java
// set attempts to 0
int attempts = 0;
// enter loop if condition is true
while (passcode != 0524 && attempts < 4) {
  System.out.println("Try again.");
  passcode = getNewPasscode();
  attempts += 1;
  // is condition still true?
  // if so, repeat code block
}
// exit when condition is not true
```

`while` loops are extremely useful for running code until a specific change occurs. However, if that change never happens, beware of infinite loops!

Infinite loops occur when the condition never evaluates to `false`, potentially causing the entire program to crash.

```java
int hedgehogs = 5;
// This will cause an infinite loop:
while (hedgehogs < 6) {
  System.out.println("Not enough hedgehogs!");
}
```

In the example above, `hedgehogs` remains equal to `5`, which is less than `6`, resulting in an infinite loop.

### Instructions

1. In **LuckyFive.java**, a random number generator simulates rolling a die. Create a `while` loop that continues to loop while `dieRoll` is NOT `5`. Inside the loop, reset `dieRoll` with a new random value between `1` and `6`, and print `dieRoll` to the terminal before resetting it.

    >
    > ```java
    > while (x != 3) {
    >   // code goes here
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > To reset `dieRoll` to a new number between `1` and `6`:
    >
    > ```java
    > dieRoll = randomGenerator.nextInt(6) + 1;
    > ```

## Incrementing While Loops

When looping through code, using a counter variable is common. A counter (also known as an iterator) is a variable used in the conditional logic of the loop and is usually incremented during each iteration. For example:

```java
// counter is initialized
int wishes = 0;
// conditional logic uses counter
while (wishes < 3) {
  System.out.println("Wish granted.");
  // counter is incremented
  wishes++;
}
```

In this example, the counter `wishes` is initialized to `0`. The program keeps printing `"Wish granted."` and adding `1` to `wishes` as long as `wishes` is less than `3`. Once `wishes` reaches `3` or more, the loop exits.

The output would be:

```plaintext
Wish granted.
Wish granted.
Wish granted.
```

Counters can also be decremented:

```java
int pushupsToDo = 10;
while (pushupsToDo > 0) {
  doPushup();
  pushupsToDo--;
}
```

Here, the counter `pushupsToDo` starts at `10` and decrements by one each time. When it reaches `0`, the loop exits.

### Instructions

1. In **Coffee.java**, initialize an `int` variable called `cupsOfCoffee` with a value of `1`.
2. Create a `while` loop that runs as long as `cupsOfCoffee` is less than or equal to `100`. Inside the loop, increment `cupsOfCoffee` by `1` to prevent an infinite loop.
3. Inside the `while` loop, above the increment, print:
    ```plaintext
    Fry drinks cup of coffee #1
    ```
    The `1` should correspond to the current value of `cupsOfCoffee`. When `cupsOfCoffee` is `100`, it should print:
    ```plaintext
    Fry drinks cup of coffee #100
    ```

## For Loops

Incrementing with loops is so common in programming that Java includes specific syntax for this pattern: `for` loops. A `for` loop header consists of three parts, separated by semicolons:

1. Initialization of the loop control variable.
2. A boolean expression.
3. An increment or decrement statement.

The opening line might look like this:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // code that will run
}
```

In a `for` loop, an initialization statement runs once to initialize the loop control variable. This variable is modified in every iteration, can be referenced in the loop body, and is used to test the boolean condition. In the example above, `i` is the loop control variable.

Breaking down the example:

1. `i = 0`: `i` is initialized to `0`.
2. `i < 5`: the loop continues as long as `i < 5` is `true`.
3. `i++`: `i` increments at the end of each loop before the condition is re-evaluated.

Thus, the code runs through the loop five times. The term “iteration” refers to repeating the same block of code.

## Using For Loops

Even though `while` loops can accomplish the same tasks, `for` loops are useful because they help prevent forgetting to increment the counter, which can cause infinite loops in `while` loops.

Be aware that incorrect `for` loop headers can lead to “off by one” errors, where the loop iterates one too many or too few times. For example, to sum the first ten numbers:

```java
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
```

This code produces `45`, missing `10` because the loop stops at `9`. This can be fixed by changing the condition to `i <= 10;` or `i < 11;`. These logical errors don’t cause terminal errors but result in incorrect calculations.

### Instructions

1. Refactor the `while` loop in **Coffee.java** (which loops from `1` to `100` outputting a string) into a `for` loop. Remember the syntax:
    ```java
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      // code that will run
    }
    ```

## Iterating Over Arrays and ArrayLists

A common programming pattern is traversing, or looping through, a list of data and performing actions on each item. In Java, this list could be an array or `ArrayList`, and the loop could be a `for` loop. To traverse, we access each element via its index. Since the first index is `0`, the counter starts at `0` and increments until the end of the list.

For example, to add `1` to every `int` item in an array `secretCode`:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < secretCode.length; i++) {
  // Increase value of element by 1
  secretCode[i] += 1;
}
```

Note that the condition is `i < secretCode.length` because array indices start at `0`, so the length is one larger than the final index. Attempting to access an index equal to the length results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Traversing an `ArrayList` is similar:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < secretCode.size(); i++) {
  // Increase value of element by 1
  int num = secretCode.get(i);
  secretCode.set(i, num + 1);
}
```

`while` loops can also be used for traversal, requiring a manual counter:

```java
int i = 0; // initialize counter
while (i < secretCode.length) {
  secretCode[i] += 1;
  i++; // increment the while loop
}
```

For an `ArrayList`:

```java
int i = 0; // initialize counter
while (i < secretCode.size()) {
  int num = secretCode.get(i);
  secretCode.set(i, num + 1);
  i++; // increment the while loop
}
```

### Instructions

1. In **CalculateTotal.java**, use a `for` loop to iterate over `expenses` and sum up the `total` of all items. Initialize a counter `i` at `0`, run while `i` is less than the `size()` of `expenses`, and increment `i`.
2. Inside the loop, add the item’s value to `total`.

## break and continue

To exit a loop before it finishes or skip iterations, use `break` and `continue` keywords. The `break` keyword exits the loop:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
}
```

This outputs:

```plaintext
0
1
2
3
4
```

The `continue` keyword skips the current iteration and moves to the next:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) {
    continue;
  }
  System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

This outputs only odd numbers:

```plaintext
1
3
5
```

**For AP Computer Science A Students**: Loops can exist within methods. If a `return` keyword is executed inside a loop in a method, the loop stops, and the method exits. For example, in a method `checkForJacket()`:

```java
public static boolean checkForJacket(String[] lst) {
  for (int i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(lst[i]);
    if (lst[i] == "jacket") {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  String[] suitcase = {"shirt", "jacket", "pants", "socks"};
  System.out.println(checkForJacket(suitcase));
}
```

This outputs:

```plaintext
shirt
jacket
true
```

As soon as `"jacket"` is found, `return true;` stops the loop and exits the method.

### Instructions

1. In **Numbers.java**, inside the `for` loop iterating from `0` to `99`, create a condition to check if `i` is **not** divisible by `5`. If true, skip the iteration using `continue`. Outside the condition, print `i`. Only numbers divisible by 5 should be printed.

## For-Each Loops

Sometimes, indices are irrelevant, and only the element itself matters. For-each loops (also called enhanced loops) allow direct iteration over each item in a list (like an array or `ArrayList`) to perform actions on each item.

For example, to print each element in an array `inventoryItems`:

```java
for (int inventoryItem = 0; inventoryItem < inventoryItems.length; inventoryItem++) {
  // Print element at current index
  System.out.println(inventoryItems[inventoryItem]);
}
```

Using a for-each loop, the syntax becomes:

```java
for (String inventoryItem : inventoryItems) {
  // Print element value
  System.out.println(inventoryItem);
}
```

The `:` can be read as “in”. So, for each `inventoryItem` (a `String`) in `inventoryItems`, print `inventoryItem`. Note that assigning a new value to the for-each loop variable does not change the original list value, as it’s a copy.

**Note**: The for-each loop variable can be named anything; using the singular of a plural is a convention.

### Instructions

1. In **MostExpensive.java**, use a for-each loop to find the priciest item in `expenses`. Iterate through each `expense` in `expenses`.
2. Inside the loop, check if `expense` is greater than `mostExpensive`. If so, set `mostExpensive` equal to `expense`.

## Removing Elements During Traversal

Removing elements from an `ArrayList` during traversal requires caution to avoid errors. When an element is removed, all subsequent elements shift left, changing their indices. The counter must be managed to avoid skipping elements.

### Using `while` Loop

When using a `while` loop, do **not** increment the counter when an element is removed, as the remaining elements shift left. For example, to remove all odd numbers:

```java
int i = 0; // initialize counter
while (i < lst.size()) {
  // if value is odd, remove value
  if (lst.get(i) % 2 != 0) {
    lst.remove(i);
  } else {
    // if value is even, increment counter
    i++;
  }
}
```

### Using `for` Loop

With a `for` loop, the counter always increments, so decrease it manually when removing an item:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
  if (lst.get(i) == "value to remove") {
    // remove value from ArrayList
    lst.remove(lst.get(i));
    // Decrease loop control variable by 1
    i--;
  }
}
```

**Note**: Avoid modifying an `ArrayList` size during a for-each loop, as it can cause a `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### Instructions

1. In **Lunch.java**, inside the method `removeAnts()`, use a `for` or `while` loop to iterate through `lunchBox` and remove any element with the value `"ant"`. Return `lunchBox` after the loop.

## Review

Key points about loops:

-   `while` loops are useful for repeating a code block an unknown number of times until a condition is met:
    ```java
    int wishes = 0;
    while (wishes < 3) {
      // code that will run
      wishes++;
    }
    ```
-   `for` loops are ideal for incrementing or decrementing with a counter variable:
    ```java
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      // code that will run
    }
    ```
-   For-each loops simplify actions on each item in a list:
    ```java
    for (String inventoryItem : inventoryItems) {
      // do something with each inventoryItem
    }
    ```
