# Fizz Buzz Project - Solution

## Project Brief

### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

### Description

Fizz Buzz is a common developer interview question designed to test creative problem-solving skills in coding. The challenge is to write a program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100 with specific replacements:

-   For multiples of 3, print `Fizz` instead of the number.
-   For multiples of 5, print `Buzz`.
-   For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.

Example output pattern:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
FizzBuzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...
97
98
Fizz
Buzz
```

## Tasks

### Setting Up

1. Start by creating a skeleton for the program:
    - Create a `FizzBuzz` class.
    - Inside `FizzBuzz`, build an empty `main()` method.

### Outputting Numbers from 1 to 100

2. Write a `for` loop that starts at 1 and iterates to 100 to output all numbers from 1 to 100.
3. Inside the `for` loop, output the counter `i`.
4. Ensure your code prints every number between 1 and 100.

### Implementing Fizz Buzz Logic

5. Implement the logic to replace numbers with `Fizz`, `Buzz`, or `FizzBuzz` based on divisibility by 3 and 5. Use `if`/`else if`/`else` statements for the different conditions.

## Solution

The provided `FizzBuzz.java` file contains a complete implementation of the Fizz Buzz program, using a `for` loop and conditional statements to achieve the required output.
