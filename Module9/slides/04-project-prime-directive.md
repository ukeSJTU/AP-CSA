# Project: The Prime Directive

## Objective

-   Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)
-   Develop skills in identifying prime numbers using loops

## Description

-   Build a program `PrimeDirective.java` to create an `ArrayList` of all prime numbers in a given array
-   A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7)

## Project Requirements

-   Create a method `isPrime()` to check if a number is prime
-   Handle edge cases (e.g., numbers less than 2, number 2 as the smallest prime)
-   Use loops to check divisibility from 2 to n-1
-   Create a method `onlyPrimes()` to filter an array and return an `ArrayList` of primes
-   Test the functionality with provided numbers

## Key Concepts

-   Loops (`for` loop for divisibility checks)
-   Conditional statements (`if`/`else if`/`else`)
-   Modulo operator (`%`) for divisibility
-   `ArrayList` for storing and returning prime numbers

## Resources

-   Starter and solution code available in:
    -   `../src/projects/PrimeDirective_Starter/`
    -   `../src/projects/PrimeDirective_Solution/`
-   Each folder contains a README.md with detailed requirements
