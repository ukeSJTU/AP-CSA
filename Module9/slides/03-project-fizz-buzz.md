# Project: Fizz Buzz

## Objective

-   Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)
-   Test creative problem-solving skills in coding

## Description

-   Write a program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100 with specific replacements:
    -   For multiples of 3, print `Fizz` instead of the number
    -   For multiples of 5, print `Buzz`
    -   For multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`

## Project Requirements

-   Create a `FizzBuzz` class with a `main()` method
-   Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 100
-   Implement logic with `if`/`else if`/`else` statements to handle:
    -   Multiples of 3 (`Fizz`)
    -   Multiples of 5 (`Buzz`)
    -   Multiples of both 3 and 5 (`FizzBuzz`)
    -   Other numbers (print the number itself)

## Key Concepts

-   Loops (`for` loop for iteration)
-   Conditional statements (`if`/`else if`/`else`)
-   Modulo operator (`%`) for divisibility checks

## Resources

-   Starter and solution code available in:
    -   `../src/projects/FizzBuzz_Starter/`
    -   `../src/projects/FizzBuzz_Solution/`
-   Each folder contains a README.md with detailed requirements
