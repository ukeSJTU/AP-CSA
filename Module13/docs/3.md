## Questions

Suppose we had a function that performed one step for each element in a collection of input data. What would the Big O time complexity be for this function?

## Answer Choices

-   Logarithmic: `O(logN)`
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Linear: `O(N)`

    üëè

    Correct! If the collection contained 10 elements, the function performs 10 steps, 100 elements would be 100 steps, and so on.

-   Constant: `O(1)`
-   Quadratic: `O(N^2)`

## Questions

Suppose we had a function that took in a list of data as an input. For each element in the list, the function compared it to **all** of the other elements in the collection. What would the Big O time complexity be for this function?

## Answer Choices

-   Constant: `O(1)`
-   Linear: `O(N)`
-   Exponential: `O(2^N)`
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Quadratic: `O(N^2)`

    üëè

    Correct! Imagine a list of 5 elements. For each of the 5 elements, it would need to be compared to 4 other elements. `N = 5` and for each element we‚Äôre compa‚Ä¶

## Questions

Select the correct ordering of runtime complexity, from most efficient to least efficient.

## Answer Choices

-   `O(1)`, `O(logN)`, `O(N)`, `O(2^N)`, `O(N^2)`, `O(N!)`
-   (Selected)Incorrect:

    `O(1)`, `O(logN)`, `O(N)`, `O(N^2)`, `O(N!)`, `O(2^N)`

    Factorial time complexity `O(N!)` is less efficient than Exponential `O(2^N)`.

-   `O(logN)`, `O(1)`, `O(N)`, `O(N^2)`, `O(2^N)`, `O(N!)`
-   `O(1)`, `O(logN)`, `O(N)`, `O(N^2)`, `O(2^N)`, `O(N!)`

## Questions

With Big O notation, we evaluate a function‚Äôs runtime efficiency based on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

## Answer Choices

-   Helper function(s).
-   Number of conditionals.
-   Number of variables.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Size of input argument(s).

    üëè

    Correct! Big O is meant to give a worst case runtime of a function based on its input.

## Questions

Why are constant factors (such as `2N`) and lower order terms (`N^2 + N` becomes `N^2`) ignored when writing Big O notation?

## Answer Choices

-   We do incorporate lower order terms and constant factors into Big O notation!
-   (Selected)Correct:

    As the input to the function grows towards infinity, lower order terms and constant factors become insignificant compared to the term with the highest order of magnitude.

    üëè

    Correct! Imagine a runtime complexity of `N + 10`. When `N` is equal to `5`, the constant factor appears significant, but with Big O we‚Äôre considering inputs‚Ä¶

    Show more

-   We cannot be sure of the significance of lower order terms as they relate to the constant factors.
-   As the input to the function grows towards infinity, lower order terms and constant factors cancel each other out.

## Questions

Suppose we had a function that iterated through a collection of data once to find the minimum value, and then again in a separate iteration to find the maximum value. How would we write the Big O time complexity?

## Answer Choices

-   `O(N^2)`
-   (Selected)Correct:

    `O(N)`

    üëè

    Correct! Even though we are looping twice, these iterations are not nested. If the input is `N`, we can leave off the `2` which indicates the number of repea‚Ä¶

## Questions

A function which only performed the operation `6 + 9` would be which Big O time complexity?

## Answer Choices

-   Factorial: `O(N!)`
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Constant: `O(1)`

    üëè

    Correct! This function would be performing a mathematical operation independent of the input, which makes it `O(1)`.

-   Linear: `O(N)`
-   Logarithmic: `O(logN)`

## Questions

An identical algorithm written in two different programming languages will have the same Big O runtime complexity.

## Answer Choices

-   False.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    True.

    üëè

    Correct! Big O is meant to be coarse enough to communicate the efficiency of an algorithm across programming language boundaries.

## Questions

Why don‚Äôt we use time-elapsed (5 minutes, for example) as a measurement for an algorithm‚Äôs runtime?

## Answer Choices

-   Time-elapsed is not relevant in quantum computing.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Algorithms perform under many different circumstances (could be run on various CPUs, different programming languages, etc.), and time-elapsed is not coarse enough to communicate performance across those circumstances.

-   Time is a social construct.
-   Different units of measurement make this infeasible.
