# Module 4: Using Built-In Classes

## Overview

This module explores the use of built-in classes in Java, focusing on how they can simplify programming tasks through abstraction and pre-defined functionality.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand the concept of black box programming and the importance of preconditions and postconditions.
-   Differentiate between APIs, libraries, and packages, and learn how they interact in Java.
-   Utilize wrapper classes like `Integer` and `Double` for converting between primitive data types and objects.
-   Apply static methods from the `Math` class for numerical calculations.

## Topics Covered

-   Black Box Programming
-   APIs, Libraries, and Packages
-   Integer and Double Wrapper Classes
-   Static Methods of the Math Class
