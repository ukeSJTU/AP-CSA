# AP Computer Science Teacher Resources

Learn how to use this path as an AP Computer Science A teacher.

Even though the AP Computer Science path was built to be a stand-alone course, we feel like it can also serve as an additional resource for teachers to use in a more traditional classroom.

### AP Computer Science A Essential Knowledge

One of the resources the College Board produces is the [Exam Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a). This document describes all of the topics that will be on the AP exam.

Specifically, there is an enormous list of Essential Knowledge. For example,

> MOD-1.A.1 — `System.out.print` and `System.out.println` display information on the computer monitor.

In this article, we've mapped every Essential Knowledge from the College Board to a lesson in this course. (Note: A detailed mapping table is available in the original resource.)

Once again, if you’re a student taking this path, this information isn’t necessary for you to follow — you should be able to take the path from start to finish and learn all of this material. However, if you are a teacher using this course as supplemental material, we hope this helps identify which lesson to use for a given standard.

### Using This Course in Your Classroom

Don't worry if students don't stick to this exact activity schedule. Students may end up spending a majority of their time on the lesson and that's okay! Let's go over the different parts of this course.

#### Lesson

Our lessons consist of several interactive exercises. A single exercise usually contains a narrative, checkpoints, and a code editor. The narrative explains a topic for students to read about. Once they finish reading the narrative, students will move onto the checkpoints which are used as a check for understanding. The checkpoints will ask students to use the code editor to perform a specific coding task related to the narrative. Once the student’s code is satisfactory, the student can move on to the next exercise.

The lesson could take anywhere from 30 minutes to the complete 60 minutes depending on how quickly the student gets through each exercise.

#### Quiz

Our quizzes are used to test how well a learner retained the information from a lesson. Each quiz is made up of both multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. At the end of the quiz, students receive a score about how they did with the multiple-choice. Learners have the option to retake the quiz if they feel that they can improve their score.

#### Project

Learners can apply their understanding of a lesson by working on a guided project. Projects in this course are made up of different tasks for a learner to complete. Since projects are open-ended, students may not be able to finish a full project within an hour. With their accounts, a student’s work is saved to the learning environment so that they can continue working on their projects at a later time.

### Wrapping Up

We hope this resource helps teachers feel confident about teaching the AP material and that students feel prepared the day of the AP exam.

If you have any students who are excited about coding and want to continue educating themselves about it, encourage them to explore additional resources.
