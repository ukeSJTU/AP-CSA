# 2D Arrays: Image Manipulation Project

## Project Brief

### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

### Overview

In this project, you will create an application to modify images and create new images using 2D arrays. The first section covers stretching the image horizontally, shrinking the image vertically, negating the color, applying a color filter, and inverting the image. The second section covers creating an image consisting of random pixels, placing a rectangle in the image, and using the method to randomly place many rectangles in the image.

Here is an overview of how images work in Java:

Images consist of pixels, which are individual points in the image containing some color. Each pixel has red, green, blue, and alpha values representing the amount of each color in the pixel. The red, green, and blue values can be mixed to create all visible colors on your screen. The alpha value represents the transparency of the pixel (or how close the color of the pixel is to the background color of the image). A higher resolution image means that there are more pixels contained within it.

In Java, a loaded image is stored in a `BufferedImage` object. From this object, we can extract each pixel value and store it into a 2D array which we can manipulate. The pixel values are stored as `int`s because each pixel value in the `BufferedImage` object is represented by a hexadecimal value containing the red, green, blue, and alpha components. The maximum value of any RGBA value is 255, and the minimum is 0. Some methods are provided in this project to handle the conversion between images and 2D arrays as well as extracting the R, G, B, and A values from a pixel. You will only need to implement methods that work with the 2D arrays.

Each of these methods is executable independently, so you can select which methods to complete or complete all of them. There are many parts to this project, so it may feel overwhelming at first. Remember, the goal is to practice using 2D arrays.

## Provided Method Details

1. **imgToTwoD()**: This method accepts a `String` which can be a file path or image URL. It returns a 2D array of integers that contains every pixel from the image stored as `int` hexadecimal values containing the RGBA values for the pixel. In the `main()` method, we can load image data into a 2D array of `int`s using this method. Provided images are `"./apple.jpg"`, `"./flower.jpg"`, and `"./kitten.jpg"`.

2. **twoDToImage()**: This method accepts a 2D array of integers and a `String` for the file name. It converts the 2D array of `int` pixel data into an image and saves it. We'll use this method to create images after modifying the 2D array of `int`s.

3. **getRGBAFromPixel()**: This method accepts an `int` value representing the pixel hexadecimal value and returns a 4-element `int` array consisting of the R, G, B, and A values (between 0 and 255). In Java, pixels are stored as hexadecimal values. This method extracts the color components from the hexadecimal value for the pixel.

4. **getColorIntValFromRGBA()**: This method accepts an array of integers that represent the RGBA values and converts it into a single `int` value representing the pixel hexadecimal value. Since pixels in Java are stored as hexadecimal values, this method converts the array of red, green, blue, and alpha values back into a hexadecimal value.

5. **viewImageData()**: This method is used to view the structure of the image data in both raw pixel form and extracted RGBA form by extracting a 3x3 section from the top left of the image. You can uncomment the call to `viewImageData` in the `main()` method after the image is loaded to see the console output, then re-comment it to clean up output for the rest of the project.

## Example Method Walkthrough: trimBorders()

This method accepts a 2D array of `int` pixel data and the number of pixels to trim off the borders of the image. It returns the modified image 2D array.

-   The method checks if it is possible to trim the number of pixels provided. It ensures the number of rows (height) and columns (width) in the 2D array is greater than twice the trimmed amount. If not valid, it prints a message and returns the unedited image data.
-   If valid, a new 2D array is created with dimensions equal to the original image's height minus the total trimmed amount for top and bottom borders, and width minus the trimmed amount for left and right borders.
-   It iterates through every position in the new 2D array, copying a portion of the original image by adjusting the position by the trimmed pixel amount to avoid out-of-bounds exceptions.
-   Finally, it returns the modified image data.

In the `main()` method, load image data into a 2D array using `imgToTwoD()`, call `trimBorders()` with the loaded image data, store the returned modified image data, and save it using `twoDToImage()` with a provided file name. View the modified image by entering the saved file name in a browser.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] imageData = imgToTwoD("./apple.jpg");
int[][] trimmed = trimBorders(imageData, 60);
twoDToImage(trimmed, "./trimmed_apple.jpg");
```

## Create a Negative Version of the Image

The `negativeColor()` method replaces the color of each pixel in the image with the negative version of the pixel, meaning each color component (R, G, B) will be replaced with 255 minus the current value.

### Steps

1. Create a new 2D array of `int`s the same size as the input image and set up nested `for` loops to iterate through every pixel in row-major order.
2. Within the inner `for` loop, get the R, G, B, and A values from each pixel using `getRGBAFromPixel()`.
3. Set the first three elements (R, G, B) to 255 minus their current value.
4. Convert the modified RGBA array back to an `int` hexadecimal pixel value using `getColorIntValFromRGBA()` and store it in the new image.
5. Return the modified image. In the `main()` method, load an image, pass it into `negativeColor()`, save the modified image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] imageData = imgToTwoD("./apple.jpg");
int[][] negative = negativeColor(imageData);
twoDToImage(negative, "./negative_apple.jpg");
```

### Expected Output

## Stretch the Image Horizontally

The `stretchHorizontally()` method doubles the width of the provided image data by copying each pixel and placing two duplicate pixels side-by-side in the new modified image.

### Steps

1. Create a new 2D array of `int`s with the same number of rows but twice the number of columns as the input image.
2. Set up nested `for` loops to iterate through every pixel in the input image using row-major order. Create an additional variable to track the position in the modified image, equal to double the column index.
3. Copy the current pixel to the modified image at the doubled position and the next position (`it` and `it+1`).
4. Return the modified image. In the `main()` method, load an image, pass it into `stretchHorizontally()`, save the modified image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] imageData = imgToTwoD("./apple.jpg");
int[][] stretchedHImg = stretchHorizontally(imageData);
twoDToImage(stretchedHImg, "./stretched_apple.jpg");
```

### Expected Output

![A stretched apple](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/stretched_apple.png)

## Shrink the Image Vertically

The `shrinkVertically()` method halves the height of the image by selecting every other pixel down each column to place in the modified image.

### Steps

1. Create a new 2D array of `int`s with half the number of rows of the input image and the same number of columns.
2. Use nested `for` loops to iterate through each pixel in the input image using column-major order, incrementing the inner loop iterator by 2 and ending one pixel early in the vertical direction to avoid out-of-bounds access.
3. Place the current pixel from the input image at the row index divided by 2 and the current column index in the new array.
4. Return the modified image. In the `main()` method, load an image, pass it into `shrinkVertically()`, save the modified image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] imageData = imgToTwoD("./apple.jpg");
int[][] shrankVImg = shrinkVertically(imageData);
twoDToImage(shrankVImg, "./shrank_apple.jpg");
```

### Expected Output

![An image of a shrunken apple](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/shrank_apple.png)

## Invert the Image

The `invertImage()` method flips the image vertically and horizontally.

### Steps

1. Create a new 2D array the same size as the input image.
2. Iterate through each pixel in the input image using nested `for` loops.
3. Copy the pixel to the new array at the position calculated as the final row position minus the current row index and the final column position minus the column index.
4. Return the modified image. In the `main()` method, load an image, pass it into `invertImage()`, save the modified image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] imageData = imgToTwoD("./apple.jpg");
int[][] invertedImg = invertImage(imageData);
twoDToImage(invertedImg, "./inverted_apple.jpg");
```

### Expected Output

![An apple flipped horizontally and vertically](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/inverted_apple.png)

## Applying a Color Filter

The `colorFilter()` method modifies every pixel in the image by provided R, G, and B values as input parameters, ensuring each color value stays within the range of 0-255.

### Steps

1. Create a new 2D array the same size as the input image.
2. Loop through each pixel in the input image using nested `for` loops.
3. Extract the RGBA color values using `getRGBAFromPixel()`.
4. Store the values of each color plus the modifier value (which can be positive or negative).
5. Test that each new color value does not go outside the range 0 to 255, setting it to 0 if less than 0, or 255 if greater than 255.
6. Set the values in the RGBA array to the new color values.
7. Convert the RGBA array to a single `int` containing the hexadecimal pixel data using `getColorIntValFromRGBA()` and store it in the new image.
8. Return the modified image. In the `main()` method, load an image, pass it into `colorFilter()` with modifier values for red, green, and blue, save the modified image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] imageData = imgToTwoD("./apple.jpg");
int[][] coloredImg = colorFilter(imageData, -75, 30, -30);
twoDToImage(coloredImg, "./colored_apple.jpg");
```

### Expected Output

## Further Challenges: Painting an Image of Random Colors

The following sections are additional challenges for more practice with 2D arrays. The `paintRandomImage()` method modifies the image passed in by replacing every pixel with a randomly colored pixel.

### Steps

1. Create a new object of the `Random` class.
2. Iterate through each pixel in the provided image using nested `for` loops.
3. Generate three random integers between 0 and 255 for R, G, and B using `rand.nextInt(256)`.
4. Store these in an `int` array with 255 for the A value.
5. Convert the array to an `int` hexadecimal pixel value using `getColorIntValFromRGBA()` and store it in the input image.
6. Return the modified input image. In the `main()` method, create a new 2D array of `int`s (e.g., 500x500) as a blank canvas, pass it into `paintRandomImage()`, save the image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] blankImg = new int[500][500];
int[][] randomImg = paintRandomImage(blankImg);
twoDToImage(randomImg, "./random_img.jpg");
```

## Drawing a Rectangle on an Image

The `paintRectangle()` method draws a rectangle on an image using provided `width`, `height`, `rowPosition`, `columnPosition`, and `color`.

### Steps

1. Iterate through every pixel in the input image using nested `for` loops.
2. Check if the current row index is greater than or equal to `rowPosition` and less than or equal to `rowPosition + width`.
3. Check if the current column index is greater than or equal to `colPosition` and less than or equal to `colPosition + height`.
4. If both conditions are true, paint the pixel the provided color.
5. Return the modified input image. In the `main()` method, pass an image into `paintRectangle()` with desired values for the rectangle, create a color using an RGBA array and `getColorIntValFromRGBA()`, save the image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[] rgba = {255, 255, 0, 255};
int[][] rectangleImg = paintRectangle(randomImg, 200, 200, 100, 100, getColorIntValFromRGBA(rgba));
twoDToImage(rectangleImg, "./rectangle.jpg");
```

## Create Abstract Geometric Art Utilizing the paintRectangle Method

The `generateRectangles()` method uses `paintRectangle()` to paint a piece of art by generating randomly positioned, sized, and colored rectangles based on the provided number of rectangles.

### Steps

1. Create an object of the `Random` class.
2. Iterate for the number of rectangles provided using a `for` loop.
3. Generate and store two random integers for the width and height of the rectangle using the number of columns and rows in the 2D array.
4. Generate and store two random integers for row and column positions, ensuring the rectangle does not get created outside the image by subtracting the random width and height from the total dimensions.
5. Create a random color by generating three random values between 0 and 255, storing them in an array with 255 for the A value, and converting it to an `int` using `getColorIntValFromRGBA()`.
6. Call `paintRectangle()` with all values and overwrite the input image.
7. Return the modified input image. In the `main()` method, pass an image into `generateRectangles()` with a number of rectangles (e.g., 1000), save the image, and view it.

### Code Example

```java
int[][] generatedRectangles = generateRectangles(randomImg, 1000);
twoDToImage(generatedRectangles, "./generated_rect.jpg");
```
