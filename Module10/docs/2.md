Which of the following is true about nested loop iteration?

## Answer Choices

-   The inner-most nested loop must complete all of its iterations before the outer loop begins.
-   The outer-most loop must complete all of its iterations before the inner loop iterates.
-   The outer-most loop and and inner-most loop will always iterate at the same rate.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    The inner-most nested loop must complete all of its iterations before the outer loop continues.

# Quiz: Quiz: 2D Arrays in Java

## Questions

Which answer describes how you should set up enhanced `for` loops to iterate through the provided 2D array of `Strings`?

### Code

```
public class EnhancedForLoops {    public static void main(String[] args) {        String[][] strTwoD = {{"learn", "study", "remember"},                          {"read", "memorize", "grasp"},                          {"master", "know", "retain"}};    }}
```

## Answer Choices

-   The outer enhanced `for` loop iterates through each `String` value, and the inner enhanced `for` loop iterates through each `String` value.
-   The outer enhanced `for` loop iterates through each `String` value, while the inner enhanced `for` loop iterates through each array of `String`s.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    The outer enhanced `for` loop iterates through each array of `String`s, while the inner enhanced `for` loop iterates through each `String` value in the subarray.

    👏

    Correct! Good Job! This is because the 2D array is an array of array objects.

-   The outer enhanced `for` loop iterates through each array of `String`s, and the inner enhanced `for` loop iterates through each array of `String`s.

## Questions

Which of the following is true about Row-major order?

## Answer Choices

-   Row-major order starts at the top right of the 2D array (when viewing it as a matrix) and traverses across each row until it ends at the bottom left corner.
-   Row-major order starts at the top left of the 2D array (when viewing it as a matrix) and traverses down each column until it ends at the bottom right corner.
-   Row-major order starts at the bottom left of the 2D array (when viewing it as a matrix) and traverses up each column until it ends at the top right corner.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Row-major order starts at the top left of the 2D array (when viewing it as a matrix) and traverses across each row until it ends at the bottom right corner.

    👏

    Correct! Good Job!

# Quiz: Quiz: 2D Arrays in Java

## Questions

Fill in the code for nested loops which traverse the 2D array using column-major order.

### Code

```
public class ColumnMajor {    public static void main(String[] args) {                double[][] data = {{1.4, 7.5, 3.5, 8.7, 9.2},                {0.8, 2.6, 6.3, 3.4, 7.5}};                for(int i = 0; i < data[0].length; i++) {            for( int j = 0; j < data[i].length; j++) {                System.out.println(data[j][i]);            }        }    }}
```

## Answer Choices

-   data
-   data.size
-   data.length
-   data\[j\].length

Click or drag and drop to fill in the blank

Incorrect, remember that the number of rows `data.length` is used as the inner loop terminating condition for colum-major order

## Questions

Which of the following is true about modifying elements in a 2D array?

## Answer Choices

-   When modifying an element in a 2D array, you access the element using the row index in brackets first, the variable name second, and the column index in brackets third. You then set it equal to a value.
-   When modifying an element in a 2D array, you access the element using the variable name first, the column index in brackets second, and the row index in brackets third. You then set it equal to a value.
-   (Selected)Incorrect:

    When modifying an element in a 2D array, you access the element using the row index in brackets first, column index in brackets second, and the variable name third. You then set it equal to a value.

    Incorrect, the format is `variable[row][column] = value`.
