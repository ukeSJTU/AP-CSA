As we have learned previously, an

is a group of data consisting of the same type. This means that we can have an array of primitive

[data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types)

(such as integers):

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

We can even have an array of Objects. For example, the following example shows an array of

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[String](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

Objects:

```
["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"]
```

In Java, arrays are considered Objects; therefore, we can also have an array of arrays:

```
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

These are called 2D arrays since we can logically view them as a two-dimensional matrix of values containing both rows and columns.

![Example of visualizing a 2D array](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/simpleTwoD.png)

Additionally, we can have 2D arrays which are not rectangular in shape. These are called jagged arrays:

```
[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], ['e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], ['k']]
```

![Example of visualizing a jagged array](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/jagged.png)

We won’t be covering jagged arrays in this lesson, but be aware that 2D arrays don’t always have to have the same number of subarrays in each array. This would cause the shape of the 2D array to not be rectangular.

Why use 2D arrays?

-   It is useful to use 2D arrays for situations where you need to store and organize data by rows and columns. For example, exporting data to be used in a spreadsheet.
-   You can condense multiple arrays down to a single variable using 2D arrays. For example, if you have 10 students who each have 10 different quiz grades, you can represent the overall class quiz grades as a 10x10 2D array by having each row represent a student and each column represent one of the quizzes they have taken.
-   2D arrays can be used to map out data. For example, if you want to create a game of tic-tac-toe, you can represent the game state by using a 3x3 2D array.

There are many other ways to use 2D arrays depending on the application. The only downside is that once initialized, no new rows or columns can be added or removed without copying the data to a newly initialized 2D array. This is because the length of arrays in Java are immutable (unable to be changed after creation).

2D Arrays: Java

### Declaration, Initialization, and Assignment

19 min

When declaring 2D arrays, the format is similar to normal, one-dimensional arrays, except that you include an extra set of brackets after the data type. In this example, `int` represents the data type, the first set of brackets `[]` represent an array, and the second set of brackets `[]` represent that we are declaring an array of arrays.

```
int[][] intTwoDArray;
```

You can think of this as creating an array (`[]`) of int arrays (`int[]`). So we end up with `int[][]`.

Now that we’ve declared a 2D array, let’s look at how to initialize it with starting values. When initializing arrays, we define their size. Initializing a 2D array is different because, instead of only including the number of elements in the array, you also indicate how many elements are going to be in the sub-arrays. This can also be thought of as the number of rows and columns in the 2D matrix.

```
int[][] intArray1;intArray1 = new int[row][column];
```

Here is an example of initializing an empty 2D array with 3 rows and 5 columns.

```
int[][] intArray2;intArray2 = new int[3][5];
```

This results in a matrix which looks like this:

![A 3 by 5 array of zeroes](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/empty.png)

If you already know what values are going to be in the 2D array, you can initialize it and write all of the values into it at once. We can accomplish this through initializer lists

-   In Java, initializer lists are a way of initializing arrays and assigning values to them at the same time
-   We can use this for 2D arrays as well by creating an initializer list of initializer lists

An example of an initializer list for a regular array would be:

```
char[] charArray = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
```

Similar to how a regular initializer list defines the size and values of the array, nested initializer lists will define the number of rows, columns, and the values for a 2D array.

There are three situations in which we can use initializer lists for 2D arrays:

1.  In the case where the variable has not yet been declared, we can provide an abbreviated form since Java will infer the data type of the values in the initializer lists:

    ```
    double[][] doubleValues = {{1.5, 2.6, 3.7}, {7.5, 6.4,5.3}, {9.8,  8.7, 7.6}, {3.6, 5.7, 7.8}};
    ```

2.  If the variable has already been declared, you can initialize it by creating a `new` 2D array object with the initializer list values:

    ```
    String[][] stringValues;stringValues = new String[][] {{"working", "with"}, {"2D", "arrays"}, {"is", "fun"}};
    ```

3.  The previous method also applies to assigning a new 2D array to an existing 2D array stored in a variable.

In the next exercise, we’ll look at how to assign values of individual elements.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Inside `main()` of **Main.java**, declare a 2D Array called `floatTwoD` that consists of `float values`.

    Hint

    Here is how we declare a 2D Array of `int` values called `numbers`:

    ```
    int[][] numbers;
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Initialize the 2D array `floatTwoD` to an empty 2D array with 4 rows and 10 columns.

    Do this on a new line under the declaration.

    Hint

    In the following example, we initialize the `numbers` 2D array with 5 rows and 2 columns after the declaration:

    ```
    numbers = new int[5][2];
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Declare a 2D array of `char` values called `ticTacToe` that represents this tic-tac-toe board:

    ![First Row: X, O, O. Second row: O, X, Space. Third Row: X, Space, X.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/tic_tac_toe.png)

    Use the characters `'X'`, `'O'`, and `' '` to initialize the 2D array.

    Hint

    Here we declare and initialize the 2D array called `charArray` with some characters:

    ```
    char[][] charArray = {   {'a', 'b', 'c'},   {'d', 'e', 'f'},   {'g', 'h', 'i'} };
    ```

    Remember to nest initializer lists.

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    We shouldn’t cheat, but let’s modify the code so `O` wins.

    On a new line, use initialized lists and replace all `O`’s with `X`’s and all `X`’s with `O`’s.

    > Note: Do not declare `ticTacToe` again.

    Hint

    When the 2D array already has some data in it, we declare a new instance of that 2D array like so:

    ```
    oldTwoD = new char[][]{{'a','b','c'},{'d','e','f'}};
    ```

2D Arrays: Java

### Accessing Elements in a 2D Array

8 min

Let’s first review how to access elements in regular arrays.

For a normal

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

, all we need to provide is an

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

(starting at `0`) which represents the position of the element we want to access. Let’s look at an example!

Given an array of five Strings:

```
String[] words = {"cat", "dog", "apple", "bear", "eagle"};
```

We can access the first element using index `0`, the last element using the length of the array minus one (in this case, `4`), and any of the elements in between. We provide the index of the element we want to access inside a set of brackets. Let’s see those examples in code:

```
// Store the first element from the String arrayString firstWord = words[0]; // Store the last element of the String arrayString lastWord = words[words.length-1];// Store an element from a different position in the arrayString middleWord = words[2];
```

Now for 2D arrays, the syntax is slightly different. This is because instead of only providing a single index, we provide two indices. Take a look at this example:

```
// Given a 2D array of integer dataint[][] data = {{2,4,6}, {8,10,12}, {14,16,18}};// Access and store a desired element int stored = data[0][2];
```

There are two ways of thinking when accessing a specific element in a 2D array.

-   The first way of thinking is that the first value represents a row and the second value represents a column in the matrix
-   The second way of thinking is that the first value represents which subarray to access from the main array and the second value represents which element of the subarray is accessed

The above example of the 2D array called `data` can be visualized like so. The indices are labeled outside of the matrix:

![Row and column indexes start at 0 in the top left corner and increase going to the right and down](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/indexes.png)

Using this knowledge, we now know that the result of `int stored = data[0][2];` would store the integer `6`. This is because the value `6` is located on the first row (index `0`) and the third column (index `2`). Here is a template which can be used for accessing elements in 2D arrays:

```
datatype variableName = existing2DArray[row][column];
```

Here is another way to visualize the indexing system for our example integer array seen above. We can see what row and column values are used to access the element at each position.

![Accessing the item in the top left corner would be data[0][0]](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/accessing.png)

When accessing these elements, if either the row or column value is out of bounds, then an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown by the application.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Create a variable called `int retrievedInt` and assign it to the value at the 0th row and 3rd column of the 2D array `intMatrix`.

    Print `retrievedInt` after creating it.

    Hint

    Here we access the integer at the 2nd row and 7th column of the 2D array `newMatrix` and store it in a variable called `element`:

    ```
    int element = newMatrix[2][7];
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Multiply the center value of `intMatrix` by `3` and print it.

    Make sure to access the correct element!

    Hint

    The matrix is 3 by 5, so the middle element will be located at row 1 and column 2.

    Here is how we access values in a matrix:

    ```
    variableName[row][column];  
    ```

### Modifying Elements in a 2D Array

10 min

Now let’s review how to modify elements in a normal

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

.

For a one dimensional array, you provide the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

of the element which you want to modify within a set of brackets next to the variable name and set it equal to an acceptable value:

```
storedArray[5] = 10;
```

For 2D arrays, the format is similar, but we will provide the outer array index in the first set of brackets and the subarray index in the second set of brackets. We can also think of it as providing the row in the first set of brackets and the column index in the second set of brackets if we were to visualize the 2D array as a rectangular matrix:

```
twoDArray[1][3] = 150;
```

To assign a new value to a certain element, make sure that the new value you are using is either of the same type or is castable to the type already in the 2D array.

Let’s say we wanted to replace four values from a new 2D array called `intTwoD`. Look at this example code to see how to pick individual elements and assign new values to them.

```
int[][] intTwoD = new int[4][3];intTwoD[3][2] = 16;intTwoD[0][0] = 4;intTwoD[2][1] = 12;intTwoD[1][1] = 8;
```

Here is a before and after image showing when the 2D array was first initialized compared to when the four elements were accessed and modified.

![The array now looks like {{4,0,0},{0,8,0},{0,12,0},{0,0,16}}](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/modifying.png)

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Create and initialize a new empty `int` 2D array called `subMatrix` with 2 rows and 2 columns.

    Hint

    Here is an example of how we declare and initialize an empty 4x4 2D array called `newMatrix`:

    ```
    int[][] newMatrix = new int[4][4];
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Multiply the first 2 elements of the first row of `intMatrix` by 5 and store them in the first row of the `subMatrix` array.

    Use separate lines to multiply each element of `intMatrix`.

    > Note: Remember that arrays in Java are 0-indexed!

    Hint

    Recall that arrays are always 0-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0 and the second element is at index 2.

    Here is an example of working with the first element of the first row of an array:

    ```
    addMatrix[0][0] = newMatrix[0][0] + 2;
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Multiply the first 2 elements of the second row of `intMatrix` by 5 and store them in the second row of the `subMatrix` array.

    Uncomment the provided print statement to see the result.

    Hint

    Recall that arrays are always 0-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0 and the second element is at index 2.

    Here is an example of working with the second element of the second row of an array:

    ```
    addMatrix[1][1] = newMatrix[1][1] + 8;

2D Arrays: Java

### Review of Nested Loops

11 min

We’re about to look at how we can use loops to make our lives easier when working with 2D arrays. But before we do that, let’s take a moment to refresh ourselves on how nested loops work.

Nested loops consist of two or more loops placed within each other. We will be looking at one loop nested within another for 2D traversal.

The way it works is that, for every iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop finishes all of its iterations.

Here is an example using **for** loops:

```
for(int outer = 0; outer < 3; outer++){    System.out.println("The outer index is: " + outer);    for(int inner = 0; inner < 4; inner++){        System.out.println("\tThe inner index is: " + inner);    }}
```

The output of the above nested loops looks like so:

```
The outer index is: 0    The inner index is: 0    The inner index is: 1    The inner index is: 2    The inner index is: 3The outer index is: 1    The inner index is: 0    The inner index is: 1    The inner index is: 2    The inner index is: 3The outer index is: 2    The inner index is: 0    The inner index is: 1    The inner index is: 2    The inner index is: 3
```

From this example we can see how every time the outer loop iterates one time, the inner loop iterates fully.

This is an important concept for 2D

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

traversal, because for every row in a two dimensional matrix, we want to iterate through every column. We will look more at this in the next exercise.

Nested loops can consist of any type of loop and with any combination of loops. Let’s take a look at a few more interesting examples.

Here is an example of nested while loops:

```
int outerCounter = 0;int innerCounter = 0; while(outerCounter<5){    outerCounter++;    innerCounter = 0;    while(innerCounter<7){        innerCounter++;    }}
```

We can even have some interesting combinations. Here is an enhanced **for** loop inside of a while loop:

```
int outerCounter = 0;int[] innerArray = {1,2,3,4,5};while(outerCounter<7){    System.out.println();    for(int number : innerArray){        System.out.print(number * outerCounter + " ");    }    outerCounter++;}
```

The output of the above example creates a multiplication table:

```
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 2 4 6 8 10 3 6 9 12 15 4 8 12 16 20 5 10 15 20 25 6 12 18 24 30
```

This is an interesting example, because for every iteration of the while loop, we iterate through every element of an array using an enhanced **for** loop. This is similar to the iteration pattern we use for 2D array traversal. We will be going over that in the next exercise.

Let’s practice using nested loops!

You are in charge of controlling the amount of people who reserve seats for the world famous programming contest. You have two long arrays of integers which represent the contestant’s IDs for two days of the competition. The

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

of the array represents their seat number. You need to use nested **for** loops to find if a contestant tried to register for both days. Print out the ID of the contestants who tried to register twice as well as their seat numbers for both days.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    We provided a nested for loop to print out a 10x10 multiplication table. However, the outer `for` loop contains an error (if you run the code, you will not see a 10x10 table). Fix this error.

    Hint

    In the following example, we use the `for` loop to iterate from numbers 3 to 14 inclusive:

    ```
    for(int i = 3; i <= 14; i++) { }
    ```

    A 10x10 multiplication table should iterate between 1 and 10 inclusive.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    The inner for-loop has two errors. Find and fix them.

    Hint

    In a 10x10 multiplication table, the inner `for` loop should also iterate between 1 and 10 inclusive.

    Here is the example again:

    ```
    for(int i = 3; i <= 14; i++) { }
    ```

2D Arrays: Java

### Traversing 2D Arrays: Introduction

15 min

In the last exercise, we reviewed how to use nested loops as well as how to iterate through regular arrays using loops. In this exercise, we will apply that knowledge in order to learn how to traverse 2D arrays.

Traversing 2D arrays using loops is important because it allows us to access many elements quickly, access elements in very large 2D arrays, and even access elements in 2D arrays of unknown sizes.

Let’s remember the structure of 2D arrays in Java:

```
char[][] letterBlock = {{'a','b','c'},{'d','e','f'},{'g','h','i'},{'j', 'k', 'l'}};
```

In Java, 2D arrays are like normal arrays, but each element is another

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

. This is shown by the initialized 2D array above. The outer array consists of four elements, where each element consists of a three element subarray.

Let’s see what happens when we access elements of the outer array

```
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[0]) + "\n");System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[1]) + "\n");System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[2]) + "\n");System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[3]) + "\n");
```

Here is the output of the above code:

```
[a, b, c][d, e, f][g, h, i][j, k, l]
```

As you can see, we can retrieve the entire subarray from each of the outer array elements. If you look at how we are accessing these subarrays, we are just increasing the index. This means we can access each sub-array in the 2D array using a loop!

Let’s take a look at an example which produces the same output, but can handle any sized 2D array.

```
for(int index = 0; index < letterBlock.length; index++){    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[index]) + "\n");}
```

Here is the result:

```
[a, b, c][d, e, f][g, h, i][j, k, l]
```

Now let’s remember how to access a value from the subarray. Previously, we learned that we can use the double brackets `[][]`, where the first set of brackets contains the index of the element of the outer array and the second set of brackets contains the index of the element in the subarray. If we wanted to retrieve the letter `'f'` we would use:

`char storedLetter = letterBlock[1][2];`

Since we know we can use a loop to retrieve each of the subarrays stored in the outer array, we can then use a nested loop to access each of the elements from the sub-array.

You might be wondering how we can figure out the number of iterations needed in order to fully traverse the 2D array.

-   In order to find the number of elements in the outer array, we just need to get the length of the 2D array.
    -   `int lengthOfOuterArray = letterBlock.length;`
    -   When thinking about the 2D array in matrix form, this is the height of the matrix (the number of rows)
-   In order to find the number of elements in the subarray, we can get the length of the subarray after it has been retrieved from the outer array.
    -   Remember that we retrieved the sub array earlier using this format:
        -   `char[] subArray = letterBlock[0];`
    -   Therefore, we can use this to get the length of the first subarray in the 2D array
        -   `int lengthOfSubArray = letterBlock[0].length;`
        -   When thinking about the 2D array in matrix form, this is the width of the matrix (the number of columns)
    -   In most cases, getting the length of the first subarray in the 2D array will apply to the rest of the subarrays (if it is rectangular in shape), but there are rare occasions where the length of the subarrays could be different. This occurs if the 2D array is a jagged array. We won’t be working with any jagged 2D arrays in this lesson, but it’s something to keep in mind.

Let’s look at an example!

```
for(int a = 0; a < letterBlock.length; a++) {    for(int b = 0; b < letterBlock[a].length; b++) {        System.out.print("Accessed: " + letterBlock[a][b] + "\t");    }    System.out.println();}
```

You can think of the variable `a` as being the outer loop index, and the variable `b` as being the inner loop index.

Here is the output:

```
Accessed: a Accessed: b Accessed: c Accessed: d Accessed: e Accessed: f Accessed: g Accessed: h Accessed: i 
```

Within the nested **for** loop, we can see that each of the subarray elements are being accessed by using the outer loop index for the outer array, and the inner loop index for the subarray.

Here is a diagram to help visualize how the 2D array is traversed using nested loops:

![The outer loop controls what row we're in while the inner loop controls which element of that row we're looking at](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/traversal.png)

We don’t have to only use regular **for** loops for traversing 2D arrays. We can use enhanced **for** loops if we do not need to keep track of the indices. Since enhanced **for** loops only use the element of the arrays, it is a bit more cumbersome to keep track of which index we are at. This same idea applies to while and do-while loops as well. This is why we usually use regular **for** loops except for when we want to do something simple like printing.

We have gone over how to think about 2D array traversal in terms of arrays of arrays, but there are two main ways of thinking about traversal in terms of rows and columns. These are called row-major order and column-major order.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Create an `int` variable called `rows` and store the length of the 2D array `intMatrix` in it. This dimension is the number of rows the array contains.

    Hint

    If we need to get the length of a 2D array called `newMatrix`, we would do it like so:

    ```
    someMatrix.length;
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Create another `int` variable called `columns` and store the length of the first row `intMatrix` in it. This dimension is the number of columns in the array.

    Hint

    We can get the columns of a 2D array like this:

    ```
    twoDArray[0].length
    ```

    Here, we are taking the length of the 0th element of `twoDArray`.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Replace the outer and inner for loop conditions to iterate through the 2D array `intMatrix`.

    Inside the inner `for` loop, add a line to calculate the sum of all elements of the 2D array `intMatrix`.

2D Arrays: Java

### Traversing 2D Arrays: Practice with Loops

17 min

We have seen how to traverse 2D arrays using standard **for** loops, but in this exercise, we will practice traversing them using some other loop types. For example, you may want to only retrieve elements without keeping track of the indices using enhanced **for** loops, or you could continuously update the 2D

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

until a condition is met using **while** loops.

In enhanced **for** loops, each element is iterated through until the end of the array. When we think about the structure of 2D arrays in Java (arrays of array objects) then we know that the outer enhanced **for** loop elements are going to be arrays.

Let’s take a look at an example:

Given this 2D array of character data:

```
char[][] charData = {{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'},{'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l'}};
```

Print out every character using enhanced **for** loops:

```
for(char[] charRow : charData) {    for(char c : charRow) {        System.out.print(c + " ");    }    System.out.println();}
```

Remember that the syntax for enhanced **for** loops looks like so: `for( datatype elementName : arrayName){`. Since 2D arrays in Java are arrays of arrays, each element in the outer enhanced **for** loop is an entire row of the 2D array. The nested enhanced **for** loop is then used to iterate through each element in the extracted row. Here is the output of the above code:

```
a b c d e f g h i j k l
```

Here is an example which accomplishes the same thing, but using **while** loops:

```
int i = 0, j=0;while(i<charData.length) {    j = 0;    while(j<charData[i].length) {        System.out.print(charData[i][j] + " ");        j++;    }    System.out.println();    i++;}
```

Here is the output of the above code:

```
a b c d e f g h i j k l
```

Notice how we can use different loop types for traversal, but still receive the same result.

Let’s work some example problems using different loop types!

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    We’ve provided a 2D array called `binary` and a counter called `onesCount`.

    Calculate the total number of `1`s in the 2D array `binary` using nested enhanced `for` loops and print it to the console.

    > Note: you must use nested for-loops for this task.

    Hint

    In the following example, we use nested enhanced `for` loops to print every character in the 2D array `charData` :

    ```
    for(char[] charRow : charData) {   for(char c : charRow) {     System.out.print(c + " ");   }   System.out.println(); }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    We have provided the iterators `i` and `j` and a matrix of strings called `wordData`.

    Use nested while loops and iterate through all the elements of `wordData` and print them to the console in this format:

    ```pseudo
    word [row][column]
    ```

    The print statement is given, you need to use it in the body of the inner while loop.

    Hint

    Here’s an example where we print the elements of the 2D array `charData` to the console using nested while loops:

    ```
    while(i<charData.length) {   j = 0;   while(j<charData[i].length) {     System.out.print(charData[i][j] + " ");     j++;   }   System.out.println();   i++; }
    ```

    The inner `while` loop’s iterator should be set to 0 again before entering the inner `while` loop.

2D Arrays: Java

### Traversing 2D Arrays: Column-Major Order

10 min

Column-major order for 2D arrays refers to a traversal path which moves vertically down each column starting at the first column and ending with the last.

This ordering system also conceptualizes the 2D

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

into a rectangular matrix and starts the traversal at the top left element and ends at the bottom right element. Column-major order has the same starting and finishing point as row-major order, but it’s traversal is completely different

Here is a diagram which shows the path through the 2D array:

![Showing column-major ordering - walking down one column at a time](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/column_major.png)

In order to perform column-major traversal, we need to set up our nested loops in a different way. We need to change the outer loop from depending on the number of rows, to depending on the number of columns. Likewise we need the inner loop to depend on the number of rows in its termination condition.

Let’s look at our example 2D array from the last exercise and see what needs to be changed.

Given this 2D array of strings describing the element positions:

```
String[][] matrix = {{"[0][0]", "[0][1]", "[0][2]"},                      {"[1][0]", "[1][1]", "[1][2]"},                     {"[2][0]", "[2][1]", "[2][2]"},                     {"[3][0]", "[3][1]", "[3][2]"}};
```

Let’s keep track of the total number of iterations as we traverse the 2D array. We also need to change the termination condition (middle section) within the outer and inner **for** loop.

```
int stepCount = 0;                for(int a = 0; a < matrix[0].length; a++) {    for(int b = 0; b < matrix.length; b++) {        System.out.print("Step: " + stepCount);        System.out.print(", Element: " + matrix[b][a]);        System.out.println();        stepCount++;    }}   
```

Here is the output of the above code:

```
Step: 0, Element: [0][0]Step: 1, Element: [1][0]Step: 2, Element: [2][0]Step: 3, Element: [3][0]Step: 4, Element: [0][1]Step: 5, Element: [1][1]Step: 6, Element: [2][1]Step: 7, Element: [3][1]Step: 8, Element: [0][2]Step: 9, Element: [1][2]Step: 10, Element: [2][2]Step: 11, Element: [3][2]
```

As you can see in the code above, the way we accessed the elements from our 2D array of strings called `matrix` is different from the way we accessed them when using row-major order. Let’s remember that the way we get the number of columns is by using `matrix[0].length` and the way we get the number of rows is by using `matrix.length`. Because of these changes to our **for** loops, our iterator `a` now iterates through every column while our iterator `b` iterates through every row. Since our iterators now represent the opposite values, whenever we access an element from our 2D array, we need to keep in mind what indices we are passing to our accessor. Remember the format we use for accessing the elements `matrix[row][column]`? Since `a` now iterates through our column indices, we place it in the right set of brackets, and the `b` is now placed in the left set of brackets.

Here is a diagram showing which loop accesses which part of the 2D array for column-major order:

![The outer loop controls the column while the inner loop controls the row in that column.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/column_major_loops.png)

**Why Use Column-Major Order?**

Column major order is important because there are a lot of cases when you need to process data vertically. Let’s say that we have a chart of information which includes temperature data about each day. The top of each column is labeled with a day, and each row represents an hour. In order to find the average temperature per day, we would need to traverse the data vertically since each column represents a day. As mentioned in the last exercise, data can be provided in many different formats and shapes and you will need to know how to traverse it accordingly.

Let’s look at our sum example from the last exercise, but now using column-major order.

Given a 6X3 2D array of doubles:

```
double[][] data = {{0.51,0.99,0.12},                   {0.28,0.99,0.89},                   {0.05,0.94,0.05},                   {0.32,0.22,0.61},                   {1.00,0.95,0.09},                   {0.67,0.22,0.17}};
```

Calculate the sum of each column using column-major order:

```
double colSum = 0.0;for(int o = 0; o < data[0].length; o++) {    colSum = 0.0;    for(int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {        colSum += data[i][o];    }    System.out.println("Column: " + o +", Sum: " + colSum);}
```

The output of the above code is:

```
Column: 0, Sum: 2.83Column: 1, Sum: 4.31Column: 2, Sum: 1.93
```

Let’s try an example!

We will be using the same runner data from the last exercise, but this time we are going to take the average times per lap rather than per runner. This requires that we use column-major traversal.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Previously, we used row-major to iterate through the 2D array.

    We have the same 2D array.

    Update the nested `for` loops to perform the column-major traversal.

    Hint

    In the following example, we perform the column-major traversal and iterate through the 2D array `newArray`:

    ```
    for (int j = 0; j < newArray[0].length; j++) {   for (int i = 0; i < newArray.length; i++) {         } }
    ```

    Remember that we flip the outer and inner loop terminating conditions for column-major order as well as the indices in the accessors.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the inner `for` loop, add a line to sum up the values for each column and store it in the variable `lapTime`.

    Hint

    Remember that the iterators in column-major order need to be flipped since the direction we are traversing has flipped — the inner for loop variable controls the rows and the outer for loop variable controls the columns.

    Use `twoDArray[column][row]` to access the elements of the 2D array and add this value to `lapTime`.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Below the declared variable called `averageVal`, add a line to calculate the average time of each lap.

    Hint

    Remember to flip the order of the iterators.

### Combining Traversal and Conditional Logic

16 min

When working with 2D arrays, it is important to be able to combine traversal logic with conditional logic in order to effectively navigate and process the data. Here are a few ways in how conditional logic can affect 2D

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

traversal:

-   Skipping or selecting certain rows and columns
-   Modifying elements only if they meet certain conditions
-   Complex calculations using the 2D array data
-   Formatting the 2D array
-   Avoiding exceptions / smart processing

Let’s go over a few examples which use these ideas:

First, let’s think about a situation where you have some

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[string](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

data inside a 2D array. We have an application which allows users to input events on a calendar. This is represented by a 5x7 2D array of strings. Due to the fact that the number of days in each month is slightly different and that there are less than 35 days in a month, we know that some of our elements are going to be empty. We want our application to do a few things:

-   Detect which days of which weeks have something planned and alert us about the event.
-   Count the number of events for each week
-   Count the number of events for each day

Here is a visualization of what our calendar data looks like after a user has entered in some event information:

![A calendar](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/calendar.png)

Here’s what our calendar data looks like in our application

```
String[][] calendar = {{"volunteer", "delivery", null, null, "doctor", null, "soccer"}, {null, "exam 1", null, "mechanic", null, null, "soccer"}, {"volunteer", "off work", null, "birthday", null, "concert", null}, {null, "exam 2", null, null, "doctor", null, "soccer"}, {"visit family", null, null, null, null, null, null}};
```

Let’s look at some code which accomplishes the requirements above. Carefully look through each line of code and read all of the comments.

There are a few things to note:

-   Row-major or column-major order can be used to access the individual events
-   Row-major order must be used to count the number of events per week since each row represents a week

Let’s take care of the first 2 requirements in one set of nested row-major loops

```
for(int i = 0; i < calendar.length; i++) {    numberOfEventsPerWeek = 0;    for(int j = 0; j < calendar[i].length; j++) {        // We need conditional logic to ensure that we do not count the empty days        String event = calendar[i][j];        if(event!=null && !event.equals("")) {            // If the day does not have a null value and an empty string for an event, then we print it and count it            System.out.println("Week: " + (i+1) + ", Day: " + (j+1) + ", Event: " + event);            numberOfEventsPerWeek++;        }    }    System.out.println("Total number of events for week "+ (i+1) +": " + numberOfEventsPerWeek + "\n");}
```

The above code produces this output:

```
Week: 1, Day: 1, Event: volunteerWeek: 1, Day: 2, Event: deliveryWeek: 1, Day: 5, Event: doctorWeek: 1, Day: 7, Event: soccerTotal number of events for week 1: 4Week: 2, Day: 2, Event: exam 1Week: 2, Day: 4, Event: mechanicWeek: 2, Day: 7, Event: soccerTotal number of events for week 2: 3Week: 3, Day: 1, Event: volunteerWeek: 3, Day: 2, Event: off workWeek: 3, Day: 4, Event: birthdayWeek: 3, Day: 6, Event: concertTotal number of events for week 3: 4Week: 4, Day: 2, Event: exam 2Week: 4, Day: 5, Event: doctorWeek: 4, Day: 7, Event: soccerTotal number of events for week 4: 3Week: 5, Day: 1, Event: visit familyTotal number of events for week 5: 1
```

Now let’s complete the third requirement. Since we need to count all of the events for each of the weekdays, we will need to traverse the calendar vertically.

```
int numberOfEventsPerWeekday = 0;// We will use this array of day strings for our output later on so we don't have (day: 1)String[] days = {"Sundays", "Mondays", "Tuesdays", "Wednesdays", "Thursdays", "Fridays", "Saturdays"};for(int i = 0; i < calendar[0].length; i++) {    numberOfEventsPerWeekday = 0;    for(int j = 0; j < calendar.length; j++) {        // Don't forget to flip the iterators in the accessor since we are flipping the direction we are navigating.        // Remember, i now controls columns and j now controls rows        String event = calendar[j][i];        if(event!=null && !event.equals("")) {            // Make sure we have an event for the day before counting it            numberOfEventsPerWeekday++;        }    }    // Use the days string array from earlier to convert the day index to a real weekday string    System.out.println("Number of events on " + days[i] + ": " + numberOfEventsPerWeekday);}
```

The output is:

```
Number of events on Sundays: 3Number of events on Mondays: 4Number of events on Tuesdays: 0Number of events on Wednesdays: 2Number of events on Thursdays: 2Number of events on Fridays: 1Number of events on Saturdays: 3
```

This example uses many of the concepts we have learned before. We use row-major order, column-major order, as well as including conditional logic to ensure that we have data for the elements we are accessing.

Additionally, we can use conditional logic to skip portions of the 2D array. For example, let’s say we wanted to print the events for weekdays only and skip the weekends.

We could use a conditional statement such as `if(j!=0 && j!=6)` in order to skip Sunday (`0`) and Saturday (`6`).

These modifications to our 2D array traversal are very common when processing data in applications. We need to know which cells to look at (skipping column titles for example), which cells to ignore (empty data, invalid data, outliers, etc.), and which cells to convert (converting string input from a file to numbers).

Let’s try an example!

We are making a simple grayscale image editor program and we want to apply some modifications to the image. We have a 4x8 pixel image that is stored as a 2D array of integers. The integer value represents the brightness of the pixel, where the acceptable values are between `0` and `255`, inclusive.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    We have a 4x8 2D array called `imageData`.

    We want to crop down the image to 4x6, so we’ll remove the last 2 columns.

    Declare and initialize a 2D empty array called `newImage` with 4 rows and 6 columns.

    Hint

    Here we create a new empty 2D array called `newArray` with 2 rows and 3 columns:

    ```
    int[][] newArray = new int[2][3];
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Use nested `for` loops and copy the data of `imageData` to `newImage`.

    Remember not to include the cropped-out columns (the last 2 columns of `imageData`).

    > Note: use a regular `for` loop for this task with `i` and `j` for the outer and inner loops respectively.

    Hint

    To copy data from one 2D array to another, we would do it like so:

    ```pseudo
    new2DArray[row][col] = old2DArray[row][col]
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Let’s decrease the brightness of the `newImage` by 50 units.

    The value range for a pixel is 0 to 255. If the result after subtracting 50 is below 0, set it equal to 0.

    Add an `if-else` statement inside the second nested loop to implement this logic.

    Hint

    Remember to check if the value minus 50 is less than 0 when iterating through the elements of the new image.

    Use this condition to check:

    ```pseudo
    if(newImage[row][column] - 50 < 0){
      set newImage[row][column] to 0
    }else{
      set newImage[row][column] to newImage[row][column] - 50
    }
    ```

2D Arrays: Java

### 2D Array Review

19 min

Let’s review the concepts we have learned throughout this lesson.

Arrays are objects in Java, we can have arrays of objects, therefore we can also have arrays of arrays. This is the way 2D arrays are structured in Java.

We can declare and initialize 2D arrays in a few different ways depending on the situation:

```
// Declaring without initializingint[][] intTwoD;// Initializing an empty 2D array which has already been declaredintTwoD = new int[5][5];// Declaring and initializing an empty 2D array at onceString[][] stringData = new String[3][6];// Declaring and initializing a 2D array using initializer listsdouble[][] doubleValues = {{1.5, 2.6, 3.7}, {7.5, 6.4, 5.3}, {9.8,  8.7, 7.6}, {3.6, 5.7, 7.8}};// Initializing a 2D array using initializer lists after it has already been declared, or already contains data;char[][] letters = new char[100][250];letters = new char[][]{{'a', 'b', 'c'}, {'d', 'e', 'f'}};
```

We retrieve elements in a 2D

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

by providing a row and column

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

`char c = letters[0][1];`

-   We can also think of them as the index of the outer array and the index of the subarray
-   We can modify elements the same way `letters[1][2] = 'z';`

We traverse 2D arrays using nested loops.

-   We can use loops of any type, but we typically use nested **for** loops to keep track of the indices
-   Row-major order traverses through each row moving horizontally to the right through each row
-   Column-major order traverses through each column moving vertically down through each column
-   Row-major order and column-major order start and end on the same elements, but the paths are different.
-   In order to convert row-major to column-major, we need to make the outer loop terminating condition depend on the number of columns, make the inner loop terminating condition depend on the number of rows, and flip the

    Preview: Docs Loading link description

    [variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

    in our accessor within the inner loop to ensure that we don’t try to access outside of the 2D array since we flipped the direction of traversal.

Here are examples of row-major and column-major order:

```
// Row-major orderfor(int o = 0; o < letters.length; o++) {    for(int i = 0; i < letters[o].length; i++) {        char c = letters[o][i];    }}// Column-major orderfor(int o = 0; o < letters[0].length; o++) {    for(int i = 0; i < letters.length; i++) {        char c = letters[i][o];    }}
```

Conditional logic in our 2D array traversal allows us to use the data in a meaningful way. We can control which rows and columns we look at, ensure that the data we are looking at is what we want, perform calculations on specific elements, avoid throwing exceptions, and more.

Here is an example of traversal with conditional logic.

Given this 2D array of Strings:

```
String[][] words = {{"championship", "QUANTITY", "month"},{"EMPLOYEE", "queen", "understanding"},{"method", "writer", "MOVIE"}};
```

We are going to flip the capitalization of the words:

```
System.out.println("Before...");System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(words).replace("],", "],\n") + "\n");for(int i=0; i<words.length; i++) {    for(int j = 0; j<words[i].length; j++) {        if(words[i][j]!=null) {            // Check the capitalization            boolean allCaps = true;            for(char c : words[i][j].toCharArray())                 if(!Character.isUpperCase(c))                     allCaps = false;                            // Flip the capitalization            if(allCaps)                words[i][j] = words[i][j].toLowerCase();            else                words[i][j] = words[i][j].toUpperCase();        }    }}System.out.println("After...");System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(words).replace("],", "],\n") + "\n");
```

Here is the output of the above code:

```
Before...[[championship, QUANTITY, month], [EMPLOYEE, queen, understanding], [method, writer, MOVIE]]After...[[CHAMPIONSHIP, quantity, MONTH], [employee, QUEEN, UNDERSTANDING], [METHOD, WRITER, movie]]
```

Time to work some review problems!

After learning about 2D arrays, you have decided to become a CS professor and you are now teaching your class about 2D arrays. You are making an application which will keep track of their exam grades and show you

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[statistics](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/statistics)

about their performance. You will be using 2D arrays to keep track of their exam grades

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Let’s declare and initialize a 4x3 2D array of doubles called `scores` which will contain the exam data for four students.

    The rows in `scores` represent the student and the columns represent the exam number.

    Use initializer lists to store these first exam scores in the 0th column of `scores`:

    (80.4, 96.2, 100.0, 78.9)

    Store the value `–1` for the rest of the exams.

    Use the provided print statement to print the result in the console.

    Hint

    If we have to use the nested initializer lists, we would do it like so:

    ```
    datatype[][] variable = {{val1, val2, val3}, {val4, val5, val6}, {val7, val8, val9}};
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Now that we have the scores for the next exams, enter these scores for the second exam (column 1) one by one using 4 lines.

    -   89.7
    -   90.5
    -   93.6
    -   88.1

    Use the provided print statement to print the updated 2D array.

    Hint

    Here, we manually enter the values in the 0th column of the 2D array `newArray`:

    ```
    newArray[0][0] = 10; newArray[1][0] = 20;
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    We just remembered that we need to keep track of only 2 exams.

    Declare and initialize an empty 4x2 2D array of double values called `newScores`.

    Hint

    In the following example, we declare and initialize an empty 4x2 2D array of integer values called `newScores`:

    ```
    int[][] newArray = new int[4][2];
    ```

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Use `for` loops to copy the scores of exam 1 and exam 2 from `scores` to `newScores` 2D array. (Do not include the -1 values).

    > Note: For internal testing purposes, please use `i` and `j` as the counters for the outer and inner loops respectively.

    Hint

    This is how we can iterate through a 2D array:

    ```
    for (int i = 0; i < array2D.length; i++) {   for (int j = 0; j < array2D[i].length; j++) {   } }            
    ```

    We can copy the values using: `twoDArrayOne[i][j] = twoDArrayTwo[i][j];` when in a nested loop.

5.  Checkpoint 5 Passed

    5.

    We allowed the students to complete an extra credit activity to contribute towards their scores.

    Iterate through the `newScores` 2D array and use an `if` statement to add 2 additional points to the grade if the exam grade is less than 90.

    Hint

    We need to check if the grades are under 90 using the `if` statement.

    Use this syntax to check it and then if the condition is true, we’ll increase the element by 2:

    ```
    2DArray[row][column] < 90;
    ```
