# Two-Dimensional Arrays in Java

## Introduction to 2D Arrays

As we have learned previously, an array is a group of data consisting of the same type. This means that we can have an array of primitive data types (such as integers):

```java
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

We can even have an array of Objects. For example, the following example shows an array of String Objects:

```java
["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"]
```

In Java, arrays are considered Objects; therefore, we can also have an array of arrays:

```java
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

These are called 2D arrays since we can logically view them as a two-dimensional matrix of values containing both rows and columns.

![Example of visualizing a 2D array](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/simpleTwoD.png)

Additionally, we can have 2D arrays which are not rectangular in shape. These are called jagged arrays:

```java
[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], ['e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], ['k']]
```

![Example of visualizing a jagged array](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/jagged.png)

We won't be covering jagged arrays in this lesson, but be aware that 2D arrays don't always have to have the same number of subarrays in each array. This would cause the shape of the 2D array to not be rectangular.

### Why use 2D arrays?

-   It is useful to use 2D arrays for situations where you need to store and organize data by rows and columns. For example, exporting data to be used in a spreadsheet.
-   You can condense multiple arrays down to a single variable using 2D arrays. For example, if you have 10 students who each have 10 different quiz grades, you can represent the overall class quiz grades as a 10x10 2D array by having each row represent a student and each column represent one of the quizzes they have taken.
-   2D arrays can be used to map out data. For example, if you want to create a game of tic-tac-toe, you can represent the game state by using a 3x3 2D array.

There are many other ways to use 2D arrays depending on the application. The only downside is that once initialized, no new rows or columns can be added or removed without copying the data to a newly initialized 2D array. This is because the length of arrays in Java are immutable (unable to be changed after creation).

### Visual Representation

![Displaying 2D arrays in three different ways](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/two_d_arrays.png)

## Declaration, Initialization, and Assignment

When declaring 2D arrays, the format is similar to normal, one-dimensional arrays, except that you include an extra set of brackets after the data type. In this example, `int` represents the data type, the first set of brackets `[]` represent an array, and the second set of brackets `[]` represent that we are declaring an array of arrays.

```java
int[][] intTwoDArray;
```

You can think of this as creating an array (`[]`) of int arrays (`int[]`). So we end up with `int[][]`.

Now that we've declared a 2D array, let's look at how to initialize it with starting values. When initializing arrays, we define their size. Initializing a 2D array is different because, instead of only including the number of elements in the array, you also indicate how many elements are going to be in the sub-arrays. This can also be thought of as the number of rows and columns in the 2D matrix.

```java
int[][] intArray1;
intArray1 = new int[row][column];
```

Here is an example of initializing an empty 2D array with 3 rows and 5 columns.

```java
int[][] intArray2;
intArray2 = new int[3][5];
```

This results in a matrix which looks like this:

![A 3 by 5 array of zeroes](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/empty.png)

If you already know what values are going to be in the 2D array, you can initialize it and write all of the values into it at once. We can accomplish this through initializer lists:

-   In Java, initializer lists are a way of initializing arrays and assigning values to them at the same time.
-   We can use this for 2D arrays as well by creating an initializer list of initializer lists.

An example of an initializer list for a regular array would be:

```java
char[] charArray = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
```

Similar to how a regular initializer list defines the size and values of the array, nested initializer lists will define the number of rows, columns, and the values for a 2D array.

There are three situations in which we can use initializer lists for 2D arrays:

1. In the case where the variable has not yet been declared, we can provide an abbreviated form since Java will infer the data type of the values in the initializer lists:

    ```java
    double[][] doubleValues = {{1.5, 2.6, 3.7}, {7.5, 6.4, 5.3}, {9.8, 8.7, 7.6}, {3.6, 5.7, 7.8}};
    ```

2. If the variable has already been declared, you can initialize it by creating a `new` 2D array object with the initializer list values:

    ```java
    String[][] stringValues;
    stringValues = new String[][] {{"working", "with"}, {"2D", "arrays"}, {"is", "fun"}};
    ```

3. The previous method also applies to assigning a new 2D array to an existing 2D array stored in a variable.

### Instructions

1. Inside `main()` of **Main.java**, declare a 2D Array called `floatTwoD` that consists of `float` values.

    > Hint
    > Here is how we declare a 2D Array of `int` values called `numbers`:
    >
    > ```java
    > int[][] numbers;
    > ```

2. Initialize the 2D array `floatTwoD` to an empty 2D array with 4 rows and 10 columns. Do this on a new line under the declaration.

    > Hint
    > In the following example, we initialize the `numbers` 2D array with 5 rows and 2 columns after the declaration:
    >
    > ```java
    > numbers = new int[5][2];
    > ```

3. Declare a 2D array of `char` values called `ticTacToe` that represents this tic-tac-toe board:

    ![First Row: X, O, O. Second row: O, X, Space. Third Row: X, Space, X.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/tic_tac_toe.png)

    Use the characters `'X'`, `'O'`, and `' '` to initialize the 2D array.

    > Hint
    > Here we declare and initialize the 2D array called `charArray` with some characters:
    >
    > ```java
    > char[][] charArray = { {'a', 'b', 'c'}, {'d', 'e', 'f'}, {'g', 'h', 'i'} };
    > ```
    >
    > Remember to nest initializer lists.

4. We shouldn't cheat, but let's modify the code so `O` wins. On a new line, use initialized lists and replace all `O`'s with `X`'s and all `X`'s with `O`'s.

    > Note: Do not declare `ticTacToe` again.
    > Hint
    > When the 2D array already has some data in it, we declare a new instance of that 2D array like so:
    >
    > ```java
    > oldTwoD = new char[][]{{'a','b','c'},{'d','e','f'}};
    > ```

### Code Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare a 2d array of float values called floatTwoD
        float[][] floatTwoD;
        floatTwoD = new float[4][10];
        char[][] ticTacToe = {{'X', 'O', 'O'}, {'O', 'X', ' '}, {'X', ' ', 'X'}};
        ticTacToe = new char[][] {{'O', 'X', 'X'}, {'X', 'O', ' '}, {'O', ' ', 'O'}};
    }
}
```

## Accessing Elements in a 2D Array

Let's first review how to access elements in regular arrays. For a normal array, all we need to provide is an index (starting at `0`) which represents the position of the element we want to access. Let's look at an example!

Given an array of five Strings:

```java
String[] words = {"cat", "dog", "apple", "bear", "eagle"};
```

We can access the first element using index `0`, the last element using the length of the array minus one (in this case, `4`), and any of the elements in between. We provide the index of the element we want to access inside a set of brackets. Let's see those examples in code:

```java
// Store the first element from the String array
String firstWord = words[0];
// Store the last element of the String array
String lastWord = words[words.length-1];
// Store an element from a different position in the array
String middleWord = words[2];
```

Now for 2D arrays, the syntax is slightly different. This is because instead of only providing a single index, we provide two indices. Take a look at this example:

```java
// Given a 2D array of integer data
int[][] data = {{2,4,6}, {8,10,12}, {14,16,18}};
// Access and store a desired element
int stored = data[0][2];
```

There are two ways of thinking when accessing a specific element in a 2D array:

-   The first way of thinking is that the first value represents a row and the second value represents a column in the matrix.
-   The second way of thinking is that the first value represents which subarray to access from the main array and the second value represents which element of the subarray is accessed.

The above example of the 2D array called `data` can be visualized like so. The indices are labeled outside of the matrix:

![Row and column indexes start at 0 in the top left corner and increase going to the right and down](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/indexes.png)

Using this knowledge, we now know that the result of `int stored = data[0][2];` would store the integer `6`. This is because the value `6` is located on the first row (index `0`) and the third column (index `2`). Here is a template which can be used for accessing elements in 2D arrays:

```java
datatype variableName = existing2DArray[row][column];
```

Here is another way to visualize the indexing system for our example integer array seen above. We can see what row and column values are used to access the element at each position.

![Accessing the item in the top left corner would be data[0][0]](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/accessing.png)

When accessing these elements, if either the row or column value is out of bounds, then an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown by the application.

### Instructions

1. Create a variable called `int retrievedInt` and assign it to the value at the 0th row and 3rd column of the 2D array `intMatrix`. Print `retrievedInt` after creating it.

    > Hint
    > Here we access the integer at the 2nd row and 7th column of the 2D array `newMatrix` and store it in a variable called `element`:
    >
    > ```java
    > int element = newMatrix[2][7];
    > ```

2. Multiply the center value of `intMatrix` by `3` and print it. Make sure to access the correct element!

    > Hint
    > The matrix is 3 by 5, so the middle element will be located at row 1 and column 2.
    > Here is how we access values in a matrix:
    >
    > ```java
    > variableName[row][column];
    > ```

### Code Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the provided 2D array
        int[][] intMatrix = {
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
            {2, 4, 6, 8, 0},
            {9, 8, 7, 6, 5}
        };
        int retrievedInt = intMatrix[0][3];
        System.out.println(retrievedInt);
        int centerValue = intMatrix[1][2];
        System.out.println(centerValue * 3);
    }
}
```

### Output

```

18
```

## Modifying Elements in a 2D Array

Now let's review how to modify elements in a normal array. For a one-dimensional array, you provide the index of the element which you want to modify within a set of brackets next to the variable name and set it equal to an acceptable value:

```java
storedArray[5] = 10;
```

For 2D arrays, the format is similar, but we will provide the outer array index in the first set of brackets and the subarray index in the second set of brackets. We can also think of it as providing the row in the first set of brackets and the column index in the second set of brackets if we were to visualize the 2D array as a rectangular matrix:

```java
twoDArray[1][3] = 150;
```

To assign a new value to a certain element, make sure that the new value you are using is either of the same type or is castable to the type already in the 2D array.

Let's say we wanted to replace four values from a new 2D array called `intTwoD`. Look at this example code to see how to pick individual elements and assign new values to them.

```java
int[][] intTwoD = new int[4][3];
intTwoD[3][2] = 16;
intTwoD[0][0] = 4;
intTwoD[2][1] = 12;
intTwoD[1][1] = 8;
```

Here is a before and after image showing when the 2D array was first initialized compared to when the four elements were accessed and modified.

![The array now looks like {{4,0,0},{0,8,0},{0,12,0},{0,0,16}}](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/modifying.png)

### Instructions

1. Create and initialize a new empty `int` 2D array called `subMatrix` with 2 rows and 2 columns.

    > Hint
    > Here is an example of how we declare and initialize an empty 4x4 2D array called `newMatrix`:
    >
    > ```java
    > int[][] newMatrix = new int[4][4];
    > ```

2. Multiply the first 2 elements of the first row of `intMatrix` by 5 and store them in the first row of the `subMatrix` array. Use separate lines to multiply each element of `intMatrix`.

    > Note: Remember that arrays in Java are 0-indexed!
    > Hint
    > Recall that arrays are always 0-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0 and the second element is at index 2.
    > Here is an example of working with the first element of the first row of an array:
    >
    > ```java
    > addMatrix[0][0] = newMatrix[0][0] + 2;
    > ```

3. Multiply the first 2 elements of the second row of `intMatrix` by 5 and store them in the second row of the `subMatrix` array. Uncomment the provided print statement to see the result.

    > Hint
    > Recall that arrays are always 0-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0 and the second element is at index 2.
    > Here is an example of working with the second element of the second row of an array:
    >
    > ```java
    > addMatrix[1][1] = newMatrix[1][1] + 8;
    > ```

### Code Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the provided 2D array
        int[][] intMatrix = {
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
            {2, 4, 6, 8, 0},
            {9, 8, 7, 6, 5}
        };
        // Declare and initialize a 2D array called subMatrix
        int[][] subMatrix = new int[2][2];
        subMatrix[0][0] = intMatrix[0][0] * 5;
        subMatrix[0][1] = intMatrix[0][1] * 5;
        subMatrix[1][0] = intMatrix[1][0] * 5;
        subMatrix[1][1] = intMatrix[1][1] * 5;
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(subMatrix));
    }
}
```

### Output

```
[[5, 5], [10, 20]]
```

## Review of Nested Loops

We're about to look at how we can use loops to make our lives easier when working with 2D arrays. But before we do that, let's take a moment to refresh ourselves on how nested loops work.

Nested loops consist of two or more loops placed within each other. We will be looking at one loop nested within another for 2D traversal.

The way it works is that, for every iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop finishes all of its iterations.

Here is an example using **for** loops:

```java
for(int outer = 0; outer < 3; outer++){
    System.out.println("The outer index is: " + outer);
    for(int inner = 0; inner < 4; inner++){
        System.out.println("\tThe inner index is: " + inner);
    }
}
```

The output of the above nested loops looks like so:

```plaintext
The outer index is: 0
    The inner index is: 0
    The inner index is: 1
    The inner index is: 2
    The inner index is: 3
The outer index is: 1
    The inner index is: 0
    The inner index is: 1
    The inner index is: 2
    The inner index is: 3
The outer index is: 2
    The inner index is: 0
    The inner index is: 1
    The inner index is: 2
    The inner index is: 3
```

From this example, we can see how every time the outer loop iterates one time, the inner loop iterates fully.

This is an important concept for 2D array traversal, because for every row in a two-dimensional matrix, we want to iterate through every column. We will look more at this in the next exercise.

Nested loops can consist of any type of loop and with any combination of loops. Let's take a look at a few more interesting examples.

Here is an example of nested while loops:

```java
int outerCounter = 0;
int innerCounter = 0;
while(outerCounter<5){
    outerCounter++;
    innerCounter = 0;
    while(innerCounter<7){
        innerCounter++;
    }
}
```

We can even have some interesting combinations. Here is an enhanced **for** loop inside of a while loop:

```java
int outerCounter = 0;
int[] innerArray = {1,2,3,4,5};
while(outerCounter<7){
    System.out.println();
    for(int number : innerArray){
        System.out.print(number * outerCounter + " ");
    }
    outerCounter++;
}
```

The output of the above example creates a multiplication table:

```plaintext
0 0 0 0 0
1 2 3 4 5
2 4 6 8 10
3 6 9 12 15
4 8 12 16 20
5 10 15 20 25
6 12 18 24 30
```

This is an interesting example, because for every iteration of the while loop, we iterate through every element of an array using an enhanced **for** loop. This is similar to the iteration pattern we use for 2D array traversal. We will be going over that in the next exercise.

### Instructions

1. We provided a nested for loop to print out a 10x10 multiplication table. However, the outer `for` loop contains an error (if you run the code, you will not see a 10x10 table). Fix this error.

    > Hint
    > In the following example, we use the `for` loop to iterate from numbers 3 to 14 inclusive:
    >
    > ```java
    > for(int i = 3; i <= 14; i++) { }
    > ```
    >
    > A 10x10 multiplication table should iterate between 1 and 10 inclusive.

2. The inner for-loop has two errors. Find and fix them.

    > Hint
    > In a 10x10 multiplication table, the inner `for` loop should also iterate between 1 and 10 inclusive.
    > Here is the example again:
    >
    > ```java
    > for(int i = 3; i <= 14; i++) { }
    > ```

### Code Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int tableSize = 10;
        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= 10; j++){
                System.out.print(i * j);
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Output

```plaintext
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30

```

## Traversing 2D Arrays: Introduction

In the last exercise, we reviewed how to use nested loops as well as how to iterate through regular arrays using loops. In this exercise, we will apply that knowledge in order to learn how to traverse 2D arrays.

Traversing 2D arrays using loops is important because it allows us to access many elements quickly, access elements in very large 2D arrays, and even access elements in 2D arrays of unknown sizes.

Let's remember the structure of 2D arrays in Java:

```java
char[][] letterBlock = {{'a','b','c'},{'d','e','f'},{'g','h','i'},{'j', 'k', 'l'}};
```

In Java, 2D arrays are like normal arrays, but each element is another array. This is shown by the initialized 2D array above. The outer array consists of four elements, where each element consists of a three element subarray.

Let's see what happens when we access elements of the outer array:

```java
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[0]) + "\n");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[1]) + "\n");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[2]) + "\n");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[3]) + "\n");
```

Here is the output of the above code:

```plaintext
[a, b, c]
[d, e, f]
[g, h, i]
[j, k, l]
```

As you can see, we can retrieve the entire subarray from each of the outer array elements. If you look at how we are accessing these subarrays, we are just increasing the index. This means we can access each sub-array in the 2D array using a loop!

Let's take a look at an example which produces the same output, but can handle any sized 2D array.

```java
for(int index = 0; index < letterBlock.length; index++){
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(letterBlock[index]) + "\n");
}
```

Here is the result:

```plaintext
[a, b, c]
[d, e, f]
[g, h, i]
[j, k, l]
```

Now let's remember how to access a value from the subarray. Previously, we learned that we can use the double brackets `[][]`, where the first set of brackets contains the index of the element of the outer array and the second set of brackets contains the index of the element in the subarray. If we wanted to retrieve the letter `'f'` we would use:

```java
char storedLetter = letterBlock[1][2];
```

Since we know we can use a loop to retrieve each of the subarrays stored in the outer array, we can then use a nested loop to access each of the elements from the sub-array.

You might be wondering how we can figure out the number of iterations needed in order to fully traverse the 2D array.

-   In order to find the number of elements in the outer array, we just need to get the length of the 2D array.
    -   `int lengthOfOuterArray = letterBlock.length;`
    -   When thinking about the 2D array in matrix form, this is the height of the matrix (the number of rows).
-   In order to find the number of elements in the subarray, we can get the length of the subarray after it has been retrieved from the outer array.
    -   Remember that we retrieved the sub array earlier using this format:
        -   `char[] subArray = letterBlock[0];`
    -   Therefore, we can use this to get the length of the first subarray in the 2D array:
        -   `int lengthOfSubArray = letterBlock[0].length;`
        -   When thinking about the 2D array in matrix form, this is the width of the matrix (the number of columns).
    -   In most cases, getting the length of the first subarray in the 2D array will apply to the rest of the subarrays (if it is rectangular in shape), but there are rare occasions where the length of the subarrays could be different. This occurs if the 2D array is a jagged array. We won't be working with any jagged 2D arrays in this lesson, but it's something to keep in mind.

Let's look at an example!

```java
for(int a = 0; a < letterBlock.length; a++) {
    for(int b = 0; b < letterBlock[a].length; b++) {
        System.out.print("Accessed: " + letterBlock[a][b] + "\t");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

You can think of the variable `a` as being the outer loop index, and the variable `b` as being the inner loop index.

Here is the output:

```plaintext
Accessed: a Accessed: b Accessed: c
Accessed: d Accessed: e Accessed: f
Accessed: g Accessed: h Accessed: i
Accessed: j Accessed: k Accessed: l
```

Within the nested **for** loop, we can see that each of the subarray elements are being accessed by using the outer loop index for the outer array, and the inner loop index for the subarray.

Here is a diagram to help visualize how the 2D array is traversed using nested loops:

![The outer loop controls what row we're in while the inner loop controls which element of that row we're looking at](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/ap-computer-science/TwoDArrays/traversal.png)

We don't have to only use regular **for** loops for traversing 2D arrays. We can use enhanced **for** loops if we do not need to keep track of the indices. Since enhanced **for** loops only use the element of the arrays, it is a bit more cumbersome to keep track of which index we are at. This same idea applies to while and do-while loops as well. This is why we usually use regular **for** loops except for when we want to do something simple like printing.

We have gone over how to think about 2D array traversal in terms of arrays of arrays, but there are two main ways of thinking about traversal in terms of rows and columns. These are called row-major order and column-major order.

### Instructions

1. Create an `int` variable called `rows` and store the length of the 2D array `intMatrix` in it. This dimension is the number of rows the array contains.

    > Hint
    > If we need to get the length of a 2D array called `newMatrix`, we would do it like so:
    >
    > ```java
    > someMatrix.length;
    > ```

2. Create another `int` variable called `columns` and store the length of the first row `intMatrix` in it. This dimension is the number of columns in the array.

    > Hint
    > We can get the columns of a 2D array like this:
    >
    > ```java
    > twoDArray[0].length
    > ```
    >
    > Here, we are taking the length of the 0th element of `twoDArray`.

3. Replace the outer and inner for loop conditions to iterate through the 2D array `intMatrix`. Inside the inner `for` loop, add a line to calculate the sum of all elements of the 2D array `intMatrix`.

### Code Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Given the provided 2d array
        int[][] intMatrix = {
            { 4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14, 16},
            {18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30},
            {32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44},
            {46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58},
            {60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 79}
        };
        int rows = intMatrix.length;
        int columns = intMatrix[0].length;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<rows; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
                // Add a line to calculate sum of all elements
                sum += intMatrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

## Traversing 2D Arrays: Practice with Loops

We have seen how to traverse 2D arrays using standard **for** loops, but in this exercise, we will practice traversing them using some other loop types. For example, you may want to only retrieve elements without keeping track of the indices using enhanced **for** loops, or you could continuously update the 2D array until a condition is met using **while** loops.

In enhanced **for** loops, each element is iterated through until the end of the array. When we think about the structure of 2D arrays in Java (arrays of array objects) then we know that the outer enhanced **for** loop elements are going to be arrays.

Let's take a look at an example:

Given this 2D array of character data:

```java
char[][] charData = {{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'},{'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l'}};
```

Print out every character using enhanced **for** loops:

```java
for(char[] charRow : charData) {
    for(char c : charRow) {
        System.out.print(c + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

Remember that the syntax for enhanced **for** loops looks like so: `for( datatype elementName : arrayName){`. Since 2D arrays in Java are arrays of arrays, each element in the outer enhanced **for** loop is an entire row of the 2D array. The nested enhanced **for** loop is then used to iterate through each element in the extracted row. Here is the output of the above code:

```plaintext
a b c d e f
g h i j k l
```

Here is an example which accomplishes the same thing, but using **while** loops:

```java
int i = 0, j=0;
while(i<charData.length) {
    j = 0;
    while(j<charData[i].length) {
        System.out.print(charData[i][j] + " ");
        j++;
    }
    System.out.println();
    i++;
}
```

Here is the output of the above code:

```plaintext
a b c d e f
g h i j k l
```

Notice how we can use different loop types for traversal, but still receive the same result.

### Instructions

1. We've provided a 2D array called `binary` and a counter called `onesCount`. Calculate the total number of `1`s in the 2D array `binary` using nested enhanced `for` loops and print it to the console.

    > Note: you must use nested for-loops for this task.
    > Hint
    > In the following example, we use nested enhanced `for` loops to print every character in the 2D array `charData`:
    >
    > ```java
    > for(char[] charRow : charData) {
    >    for(char c : charRow) {
    >        System.out.print(c + " ");
    >    }
    >    System.out.println();
    > }
    > ```

2. We have provided the iterators `i` and `j` and a matrix of strings called `wordData`. Use nested while loops and iterate through all the elements of `wordData` and print them to the console in this format:

    ```plaintext
    word [row][column]
    ```

    The print statement is given, you need to use it in the body of the inner while loop.

    > Hint
    > Here's an example where we print the elements of the 2D array `charData` to the console using nested while loops:
    >
    > ```java
    > while(i<charData.length) {
    >    j = 0;
    >    while(j<charData[i].length) {
    >        System.out.print(charData[i][j] + " ");
    >        j++;
    >    }
    >    System.out.println();
    >    i++;
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > The inner `while` loop's iterator should be set to 0 again before entering the inner `while` loop.

### Code Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] binary = {
            {0, 1, 0, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 0},
            {1, 0, 0, 1},
            {1, 0, 1, 0}
        };
        int onesCount = 0;
        System.out.println(onesCount);
        for(int[] binRow : binary) {
            for(int n : binRow) {
                if(n==1) {
                    onesCount += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println(onesCount);
        String[][] wordData = {{"study", "consider", "examine", "learn"}, {"ponder", "read", "think", "cogitate
```
