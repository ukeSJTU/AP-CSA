[insertion sort](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm/insertion-sort)

takes one element and finds the location it belongs and inserts it.

We’ll see in a moment that insertion sort is as intuitive as sorting cards in your hand. You may not have realized it but there is a chance you applied some version of insertion sort algorithm when playing cards!

Much like selection sort, insertion sort works by dividing an input array into two virtual lists: a sorted sub-list and an unsorted sub-list.

Our sorted sub-list initially contains the first element of the input array. The rest of the elements make up the unsorted sub-list.

Insertion sort will go through the unsorted sub-list one by one, essentially removing an element from the unsorted sub-list and then **inserting** it into its correct position in the sorted sub-list by shifting all the elements in the sorted sub-list that are greater than the element being sorted.

We mentioned that this algorithm is as intuitive as sorting cards in your hand. Let’s look at an example by talking through our image on your right.

Imagine you have a set of cards laid out in front of you that you want to sort in ascending order. We will focus on the number and not the suit: `7, 2, 5, 8, -3`. Note that our deck of cards seems to have a `-3` in it! That would make blackjack more complicated!

We can assume the first card, `7` to be a part of the sorted hand.

Next, we will look at the first unsorted element, `2`, and compare it to our sorted element, `7`.

Since `2` is smaller than `7`, we’ll shift `7` one spot to the right in the sorted list and insert `2` before it.

We will continue this process for each card. We will grab the cards one by one from the unsorted hand and insert them into their correct location in the sorted hand.

The end result will be your cards sorted: `-3, 2, 5, 7, 8`

### Conceptual Exercise: Shift

1 min

Insertion sort is as intuitive as sorting a hand of cards. In real life, we just create space and insert a card into the correct position.

If you were sorting cards on a table, it’s pretty easy to insert your card into the correct position. You might not even realize you are shifting every other card down one!

However, when coding this

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[algorithm](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm)

, this idea of shifting every element to the right is one of the trickiest parts to implement.

If we take a look at the illustration we can look at what happens when we get to the final unsorted card, `-3`.

We need to find the correct place to insert it.

`8 > -3` so we shift `8` to the right.  
`7 > -3` so we shift `7` to the right.  
`5 > -3` so we shift `5` to the right.  
`2 > -3` so we shift `2` to the right.

We have now reached the front of the cards and there is nowhere further to go so we insert our `-3`.

This highlights two conditions we will need to account for in our code before we make our switch:

-   Is the already sorted item greater than the item we are attempting to sort? If so, shift it to the right. If not, insert the new card after the already sorted card.
-   Have we reached the beginning of our array? If so, insert the card.

### Insertion Sort Conceptual: Algorithm Analysis

2 min

Let’s consider how much work this algorithm does in order to sort the array. What do we mean by work? Let’s count how many operations this algorithm does! We’ll consider any time we compare two numbers to be one operation.

This algorithm makes a lot of comparisons using our two `for` loops! Given our sample data `[7, 2, 5, 8, -3]` on our first pass, we are going to make one comparison.

`2` will be compared to `7`. `2` is smaller than `7` so we will shift `7` to the right to make space to insert `2`. `2` is now in the correct position!

On our second pass, we will compare `5` with `7`. `5` is smaller than `7` so we will shift `7` to the right. `5` is not less than `2` so we will not shift over `2` and will insert `5` before `7` where we created space. We made two comparisons.

On our third pass, we will compare `8` with `7`. `8` is not smaller than `7` so we will not shift over any values. We will leave `8` where it is and consider it part of the sorted sub-list. We only made one comparison but could have made up to three if our current element was smaller than any elements in the sorted sub-list.

On our final pass, we will compare `-3` to `8`. `-3` is less than `8` so we will shift `8` over. We will next compare `-3` to `7` and shift `7` over. Next, we will compare `-3` to `5`, and shift `5` over. Finally, we will compare `-3` to `2`. `-3` is less than `2` so we will shift `2` over. This was 4 comparisons.

We made 1 comparison on our first pass, 2 comparisons on our second pass, 1 comparison on our third pass, and then finally 4 comparisons on our last pass for a total of 8 comparisons. For some of those iterations (like the third one) we got lucky! We didn’t have to do too much work to find the correct place to insert the value. However, in the worst-case scenario, we would need to make 10 total comparisons to completely sort all 5 items in the list.

Imagine the number of comparisons we would need to make with ten pieces of data `[7, 2, 5, 8, -3, 12, 6, 80, 7, -70]`. If we were unlucky and in the worst-case scenario, our last pass would make 9 total comparisons. Now, imagine a thousand pieces of data! As the size of the dataset (`n`) gets very big, it turns out that in the worst-case scenario, we need to make n^2 comparisons. In general, if you see an algorithm with a nested for loop, like this one, the algorithm is probably has a runtime of at least O(n^2), if not worse!

Insertion sort does have an interesting **best-case** scenario where an array is already sorted. Insertion sort has a **best-case complexity** of `O(n)`. Consider the case when the array is already sorted. We still need to insert every card in our hand into its proper place. But every time we check to see where that card should go, we immediately find the correct place. We need to do `1` comparison for each card, giving us a total of `n` work.

Let’s take a look at the steps needed to achieve our

[insertion sort](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm/insertion-sort)

algorithm. **Step 1:** Consider the first element in our input

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

to be part of our sorted sub-list.

```
int[] array = {7, 2, 5, 8, -3};// sorted sub-list:  7 // unsorted sub-list: 2, 5, 8, -3
```

**Step 2:** Pick the next element as your **current** value to insert.

```
int[] array = {7, 2, 5, 8, -3};// sorted sub-list:  7 // unsorted sub-list: 2, 5, 8, -3// current: 2
```

**Step 3:** Compare _current_ with all the element(s) in the sorted sub-list.

```
int[] array = {7, 2, 5, 8, -3};// sorted sub-list:  7 // unsorted sub-list: 2, 5, 8, -3// current: 2// compare: 2 and 7
```

**Step 4:** Shift all the element(s) in the sorted sub-list that are greater than _current_.

```
// shift: 7
```

**Step 5:** Insert _current_.

```
// insert: 2array = {7, 2, 5, 8, -3};// sorted sub-list:  2, 7 // unsorted sub-list: 5, 8, -3
```

      If the current element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the element before

`1` and setting the value of `current` in our unsorted sub-list to use for comparing with the values in our sorted list.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Write a `for` loop that begins with a counter, `i` set to `1`, as we consider the element at index `0` to be part of the sorted sub-list. Our loop should run the length of the input array.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside of our `for` loop, create a variable `current` of type `int` and assign it to the value of our input array at the index of `i`.

    We’ll test our code when the method is complete at the end of this lesson, but if you’d like to try calling your method and printing some values, feel free to!

    Hint

    To get the value of an array at a specific index we can use bracket notation:

    ```
    int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40};// Print item at index 2System.out.println(numbers[2]); // Prints: 30
    ```

Insertion Sort

### Comparing Current Value with Sorted Sub-List

4 min

Awesome, we have now captured the first item in the unsorted sub-list and set as `current`. We are now going to compare this to the preceding element(s) in the sorted sub-list.

Here is the skeleton we’re aiming for:

```pseudo
insertionSort(array)
  Iterate over array starting at index 1
    Compare the current element to its predecessor
      If the current element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the element before
      Move the greater elements one position up to make space
    Insert current element
end insertionSort
```

So far, we have the `for` loop to run our

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

at the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

we are iterating through in our unsorted sub-list to `current`. This is our unsorted element we will use to compare to our sorted sub-list. Now, we will create a `while` loop inside that visits the previous element(s) in our sorted sub-list. We want to work towards the beginning of our input array.

To do that, we will create a separate iterator, j, and assign it a value of `i - 1`. The first item we will compare is the last item in our sorted sub-list. Which happens to be the index just to the left of `i`.

We will next need to create an inner while loop that must satisfy two conditions:

-   We are going to start at the end of our sorted list and work backwards. We want to make sure to stop if we reach the front of our sorted list (which is index 0). The value of `j` must be greater than `0`.
-   We are going to check that the element in our sorted sub-list we are comparing is larger than `current`. The value of `array[j] > current`.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Inside of the `for` loop but after our variable `current` create a counter variable `j` of type `int` to the value of `i - 1`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Create an inner `while` loop. We also want to check the condition that `j >= 0` and that the value of `array[j] > current`.

    Hint

    Using a `while` loop to check that two conditions are both true:

    ```pseudo
    while (condition1 && condition2) {
      // execute code
    }
    ```

### Shifting the Sorted Array and Inserting Current

8 min

Great job! So far we have created a for loop that starts at

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

`1` and loops through our input array: `7, 2, 5, 8, -3`  
We have a sorted sub-list containing our first item: `7`  
Our unsorted sub-list contains the rest of our array: `2, 5, 8, -3`

Inside of our for loop we set the value of the input

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

at `i`, `arr[i]`, to `current`. Our first time through the loop, `array[i]` is equal to `2`.

We then created a `while` loop that will break if we have reached the front of the array or will break if the preceding item compared to `current` is indeed less than the value of `current`.

In this exercise we want to look at how to shift our element(s) in the sorted sub-list that is greater than current.

We will also look at how we insert `current` when either of the conditions in our `while` loop are not true.

```pseudo
insertionSort(array)
  Iterate over array starting at index 1
    Compare the current element to its predecessor
      If the current element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the element before
      Move the greater elements one position up to make space
    Insert current element
end insertionSort
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Inside of our `while` loop we want to take the value at `array[j]` and move it one element to the right. We can do this by setting `array[j + 1]` to `array[j]`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Still inside our `while` loop, reduce the value of `j` by `1`.

    Hint

    To decrement a value we can use `--`

    ```
    int value = 5;value--;System.out.println(value); // Prints: 4
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    When either of our `while` loop conditions break it means we have found the position to insert our unsorted element. Set `array[ j+1 ]` to `current` before we close our outer `for` loop. This is because if we need to insert the value to the very front of the array, then `j` would eventually become `-1`. We don’t want to insert the value into `array[-1]`, but rather `array[-1 + 1]`, or `array[0]`.

    ```
    ...for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {  int current = array[i];  int j = i - 1;  while (j >= 0 && array[j]  > current) {    array[j+ 1] = array[j];    j--;  }  // insert code here}...
    ```

    This continues for every iteration of the outer `for` loop until that also breaks by reaching the end of the input array. At this point we can consider our array sorted!

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Let’s take a look at our insertion sort algorithm in action! In the `main()` function add the following code:

    ```
    int[] numbers = {7, 2, 14, -7, 72};System.out.println("Array in ascending order");sort(numbers);System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
    ```

Nice work building your own `insertionSort()` function. An important point to remember about

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[insertion sort](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm/insertion-sort)

is that the algorithm breaks our input

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

into two virtual lists. A sorted sub-list initially containing the first element in the array and an unsorted sub-list initially containing the remainder of the items in the input array.

Let’s walk through what we actually coded.

In the `insertionSort()`

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

, we have a for loop that runs left to right, running the insertion logic until the array is fully sorted. Inside the outer `for` loop, we have a `while` loop that iterates right to left through the sorted sub-list and checks whether the previous element(s) are greater than current element. If they are, we shift them one place to the right and insert our current element. The outer loop stops running after we have reached our last element in our array.

The nested-loop structure of the algorithm makes the worst case

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[runtime](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/runtime)

`O(n^2)`. In the case of an already sorted array, insertion sort is able to cut out some of the work. We ultimately wind up with linear time of `O(n)` in the best-case scenario.

Instructions

Here we have our finished code from the last exercise. Go ahead and run the code again to see the results! Below you’ll find some more challenges:

-   Try changing the data provided to the input array. What happens when you provide just one or no values?
-   Change your algorithm so your array gets sorted in descending order rather than ascending order.
-   Change your algorithm to sort `String` values. You’ll have to do a few edits here. First, a few variables will need to be changed from `int`s to `String`s, including the type of the input array itself! Next, you’ll have to take a look at your if statement. We can’t use `>` or `<` when comparing `String`s. Instead, look into how the [compareTo()](<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)>) method works. By using `compareTo()` and seeing if the value is greater than or less than `0`, you can determine which `String` is “bigger” in value.
