# Insertion Sort: Conceptual and Implementation

## Introduction to Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds a final sorted array one item at a time. At each iteration through an input array, insertion sort takes one element from the unsorted portion and finds the correct location to insert it into the sorted portion.

Much like sorting cards in your hand, insertion sort is intuitive. You may have applied a version of this algorithm while playing cards without realizing it. Similar to selection sort, insertion sort divides an input array into two virtual lists:

-   A sorted sub-list, initially containing the first element of the input array.
-   An unsorted sub-list, containing the remaining elements.

Insertion sort processes the unsorted sub-list one by one, removing an element and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted sub-list by shifting all greater elements one position ahead.

Consider sorting a set of cards in ascending order (focusing on number, not suit): `7, 2, 5, 8, -3`. The first card, `7`, is assumed to be part of the sorted sub-list. Next, take `2` from the unsorted sub-list and compare it to `7`. Since `2 < 7`, shift `7` one spot to the right and insert `2` before it. Continue this process for each card, resulting in a sorted array: `-3, 2, 5, 7, 8`.

## Conceptual Exercise: Shifting Elements

Insertion sort is as intuitive as sorting a hand of cards, where you create space and insert a card into the correct position. When coding this algorithm, shifting elements to the right is one of the trickiest parts to implement.

Consider the final unsorted card, `-3`, in the array `7, 2, 5, 8, -3`:

-   `8 > -3`, so shift `8` to the right.
-   `7 > -3`, so shift `7` to the right.
-   `5 > -3`, so shift `5` to the right.
-   `2 > -3`, so shift `2` to the right.
-   Reached the front of the array, so insert `-3` at the beginning.

This highlights two conditions to account for in code before inserting:

-   Is the already sorted item greater than the item to sort? If so, shift it to the right. If not, insert the new item after the sorted item.
-   Have we reached the beginning of the array? If so, insert the item.

## Algorithm Analysis

Let's analyze the work done by insertion sort by counting comparisons as operations. For an array like `[7, 2, 5, 8, -3]` (size 5):

-   First pass (`2`): 1 comparison (`2 < 7`), shift `7`, insert `2`.
-   Second pass (`5`): 2 comparisons (`5 < 7`, `5 > 2`), shift `7`, insert `5`.
-   Third pass (`8`): 1 comparison (`8 > 7`), no shift, insert `8` at the end.
-   Fourth pass (`-3`): 4 comparisons (`-3 < 8, 7, 5, 2`), shift all, insert `-3` at start.
-   Total: 8 comparisons, though in the worst case, it could be 10 for size 5.

For larger datasets, like size 10 (`[7, 2, 5, 8, -3, 12, 6, 80, 7, -70]`), the worst-case last pass could require 9 comparisons. As `n` grows, the worst-case number of comparisons approaches `n^2`, giving a worst-case runtime of `O(n^2)`. Nested loops often indicate at least `O(n^2)` complexity.

Insertion sort has a best-case scenario when the array is already sorted, achieving a runtime of `O(n)`. In this case, each element requires only 1 comparison to confirm its position, totaling `n` comparisons.

## Implementation: Selecting the First Unsorted Element

Let's implement insertion sort by selecting the first unsorted element. The pseudocode focus is:

```pseudo
insertionSort(array)
  Iterate over array starting at index 1
    Compare the current element to its predecessor
    ...
end insertionSort
```

Steps in Java:

1. Write a `for` loop starting with counter `i` at `1` (since the first element at index `0` is considered sorted), running through the length of the input array.
2. Inside the loop, create a variable `current` of type `int` and assign it the value of the input array at index `i`, representing the element to insert.

## Implementation: Comparing Current Value with Sorted Sub-List

Next, compare the `current` value with elements in the sorted sub-list. The pseudocode focus is:

```pseudo
insertionSort(array)
  Iterate over array starting at index 1
    Compare the current element to its predecessor
      If the current element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the element before
      ...
end insertionSort
```

Steps in Java:

1. Inside the `for` loop, after setting `current`, create a counter variable `j` of type `int` set to `i - 1`, representing the last element in the sorted sub-list.
2. Create a `while` loop that continues as long as `j >= 0` (haven't reached the start of the array) and `array[j] > current` (the sorted element is greater than the current element to insert).

## Implementation: Shifting and Inserting

Finally, shift elements in the sorted sub-list that are greater than `current` and insert `current` into the correct position. The pseudocode focus is:

```pseudo
insertionSort(array)
  Iterate over array starting at index 1
    Compare the current element to its predecessor
      If the current element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the element before
      Move the greater elements one position up to make space
    Insert current element
end insertionSort
```

Steps in Java:

1. Inside the `while` loop, shift the element at `array[j]` one position to the right by setting `array[j + 1] = array[j]`.
2. Decrement `j` by 1 to check the next element in the sorted sub-list.
3. After the `while` loop ends (either reached the start or found the correct position), insert `current` at `array[j + 1]` to account for cases where `j` becomes `-1` (insert at index `0`).

Here is the complete implementation:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class InsertionSort {
  public static void sort(int[] array) {
    for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
      int current = array[i];
      int j = i - 1;
      while (j >= 0 && array[j] > current) {
        array[j + 1] = array[j];
        j--;
      }
      array[j + 1] = current;
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] numbers = {7, 2, 14, -7, 72};
    System.out.println("Array in ascending order");
    sort(numbers);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
  }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Array in ascending order
[-7, 2, 7, 14, 72]
```

## Review

You've built an `insertionSort()` function that divides the input array into a sorted sub-list (initially the first element) and an unsorted sub-list (remaining elements). The outer `for` loop iterates left to right, processing each unsorted element, while an inner `while` loop iterates right to left through the sorted sub-list, shifting greater elements to make space for insertion.

The nested-loop structure results in a worst-case runtime of `O(n^2)`. However, for an already sorted array (best case), insertion sort achieves linear time `O(n)` since each element requires only one comparison.

**Challenges**:

-   Try changing the input array. What happens with one or no values?
-   Modify the algorithm to sort in descending order instead of ascending.
-   Adapt the algorithm to sort `String` values by changing variable types from `int` to `String` (including the input array) and using `compareTo()` for comparisons instead of `>` or `<`. Refer to Java's `String.compareTo()` documentation to check if the result is greater or less than `0` to determine order.
