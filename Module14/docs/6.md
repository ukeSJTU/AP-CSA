# Quiz: Selection Sort in Java

## Question 1: Inner Loop for Selection Sort

Fill in the correct code for the inner for loop in the selection sort algorithm.

```java
public static void selectionSort(int arr[]) {
  int size = arr.length;
  for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
    int currentMinimumIndex = i;
    for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[currentMinimumIndex]) {
        currentMinimumIndex = j;
      }
    }
    int temp = arr[currentMinimumIndex];
    arr[currentMinimumIndex] = arr[i];
    arr[i] = temp;
  }
}
```

## Question 2: Intermediate Steps of Selection Sort

What are the correct intermediate steps when sorting the dataset `[15, 12, 40, -3]` with Selection Sort?

**Correct Answer**: `[-3, 12, 40, 15]` -> `[-3, 12, 40, 15]` -> `[-3, 12, 15, 40]`

**Explanation**: Selection sort finds the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted position in each pass. First, `-3` is swapped with `15`. Then, `12` is already in the correct position, so no swap occurs. Finally, `15` and `40` are swapped to complete the sort.

## Question 3: Efficiency of Selection Sort

Selection sort is the most efficient of the comparison sorting algorithms.

**Correct Answer**: False

**Explanation**: Selection sort is not the most efficient due to its nested loop structure, which results in a quadratic time complexity of `O(n^2)`, even in the best case. Other algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are generally more efficient.

## Question 4: Swapping Elements in an Array

Which of the following blocks of code successfully swaps two elements at `indexOne` and `indexTwo` in an array called `arr`?

**Correct Answer**:

```java
int temp = arr[indexTwo];
arr[indexTwo] = arr[indexOne];
arr[indexOne] = temp;
```

**Explanation**: A temporary variable `temp` is needed to store one of the values during the swap to avoid losing it. This code correctly swaps the values at the two indices.

## Question 5: Comparisons in Ordered vs. Unordered Lists

An input list that is mostly ordered will require fewer comparisons than an input list that is unordered.

**Correct Answer**: False

**Explanation**: Even if the list is already sorted, selection sort's inner loop must make `n` comparisons to find the smallest remaining unsorted item in each pass, resulting in the same number of comparisons regardless of the initial order.

## Question 6: Big O Runtime of Selection Sort

What is the Big O runtime of selection sort?

**Correct Answer**: Quadratic - `O(n^2)`

**Explanation**: Selection sort is implemented with nested loops that iterate through the elements of the input array, resulting in a quadratic runtime of `O(n^2)` in all casesâ€”best, worst, and average.
