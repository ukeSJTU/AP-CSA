# Linear Search with 1D and 2D Arrays

In this interactive article, we will implement a Linear Search on both 1D and 2D arrays.

Linear search is used to search for a target value in a list. We will look at the elements one by one in the list and compare them with the target value until a match is found. If we find a match, we will return the index. If we don‚Äôt we will print a message that the target was not found.

Keep in mind that linear search is great for a short list but not a good fit for dealing with large amounts of data because we search sequentially one item at a time. So if our target is at the end of our list or doesn‚Äôt exist at all this can be terribly inefficient.

**Linear Search Implementation**  
Linear search will start with the first element and check if it is a match for our target element, and will continue the search till it finds a match. The steps are:  
Step 1: Examine the current element in the list.  
Step 2: If the current element is equal to the target value, stop.  
Step 3: If the current element is not equal to the target value, check the next element in the list.  
Continue steps 1 - 3 until the element is found or the end of the list is reached.

**Linear Example**  
Given the following list: `[45, 17, 23, -19, 43, 55, 72, -44, 17]`  
We can use the linear search algorithm to find the target value `72` in a list. The algorithm moves through the list until it finds a `72` in the 6th position.

Here is the pseudocode for linear search as a method:

```pseudo
for each element in the search_list
    if element equal target value then
       print location and return index
if element is not found then
    print message not found and return -1
```

Let‚Äôs convert the pseudocode into Java!

**Linear Search on 1D Array**

We have provided you with a `LinearSearch` class already populated with a `main()` method containing an input array, `arr`, that we will search. Also, an int `target`, containing the value we will search for. We then call our `linearSearch()` method passing in `arr` and `target` as arguments.

1.  Let‚Äôs write our `linearSearch()` method. Create a method `linearSearch()` that returns an `int` value. The method should have two parameters ‚Äî an `int[]` named arr (the array we‚Äôre searching), and an `int` named `target` (the value we‚Äôre searching for).
2.  Inside our `linearSearch()` method, create a `for` loop, with a counter `i` set to `0`. The loop should run as long as our counter is less than the length of the array. Increment the counter by `1` each iteration of the loop.
3.  Inside our `for` loop check if the index of our array at the value we are iterating over is equal to `target`. If it is, print the message ‚ÄúElement is present at index \_‚Äù and then return the index to break out of our method.
4.  If we don‚Äôt find a match our loop will break. Print the message ‚ÄúElement is not present in the array‚Äù and then return `-1`.

Great job! Let‚Äôs try a little twist. Let‚Äôs imagine that you have a food allergy. Instead of searching an array for a number, let‚Äôs imagine that we are searching a food product‚Äôs ingredient list. Amend the code in `linearAllergyFoodSearch()` method to find a string in an array of strings.

## Questions

Fill in the code to complete our linear search on an array of Strings:

Hint

When comparing Strings we should use the `.equals()` method instead of `==`.

**Linear Search on 2D Array**

Now, lets take a look at using linear search with 2D arrays. What is a 2D array? Arrays are objects in Java, we can have arrays of objects, therefore we can also have arrays of arrays.

A 2D array might look like this:

```
double[][] values =¬†{¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†{1.5, 2.6, 3.7}, ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†{7.5, 6.4, 5.3}, ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†{9.8,¬†¬†8.7, 7.6}, ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†{3.6, 5.7, 7.8}};
```

We retrieve elements in a 2D array by providing a row and column index:

Example:

```
values[1][2]; // 5.3
```

We traverse 2D arrays using nested loops. We can use loops of any type, but we typically use nested **for** loops to keep track of the indices:

```
public class Main {¬†¬† public static void main(String[] args) {¬†¬†¬†public static int[][] twoDimensionalArray =¬†{{0, 1, 2}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};¬†¬†¬†for (int row =¬†0; row < twoDimensionalArray.length; row++) {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†for (int column =¬†0; column < twoDimensionalArray[row].length; column++) {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†System.out.print("Index [" +¬†row +¬†"][" +¬†column +¬†"]: ");¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†System.out.println(twoDimensionalArray[row][column]);¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†}¬†¬†¬†} }}
```

Output:

```
Index [0][0]: 0Index [0][1]: 1Index [0][2]: 2Index [1][0]: 4Index [1][1]: 5Index [1][2]: 6Index [2][0]: 7Index [2][1]: 8Index [2][2]: 9
```

Now that we have reviewed 2D arrays in Java, let‚Äôs apply linear search to one!

Pseudocode:

```pseudo
for each row in the search_list
  for each column of that row
    if element at that row and column equals the target value then
      print the index of the row and column and return 1
print message that element is not found and return -1
```

**2D Linear Example**

Given the following 2D array we are looking for a value of `3`:

```
int[][] ExampleInputArray =¬†{{0, 12 15}, {1, 3, 9}, {17, 11, 3}};
```

We can visualize a matrix:

```pseudo
[ 0, 12 15]
[ 1, 3, 9 ]
[17, 11, 3]
```

We begin with the first-row looking for a value of `3`, and traverse the columns comparing `3` to `0`, then to `12`, and finally, `15`. We do not find a match in the first row so we take a look at the second row, `1, 3, 9`. A match is found at the second row in the second column. As arrays are zero based, that means we found our match at `[1][1]`.

**Let‚Äôs now code out a linear search for a 2D array!**

Let‚Äôs imagine that we are searching for a needle in a haystack. We will be working with `String`s instead of `int`s.

Inside of our `main()` method we have been provided with a 2D `haystack` array. We also have a `target` set to a value of `‚Äùneedle‚Äù` that we will be seeking out amongst the `‚Äùhay‚Äù`.

```
class Main {¬†¬†¬†public static int linerSearch2D(String[][] haystack, String target) {¬†¬†¬†¬†// write code here¬†¬†}¬†¬†¬†public static void main(String[] args) {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†String[][] haystack =¬†{{"hay", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}, {"needle", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}};¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†String target =¬†"needle";¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†linerSearch2D(haystack, target); }}
```

Step 1: Inside of our `linearSearch2D()` method, create a `for` loop with a count variable `row` of type int, set to `0`. Our loop will run as long as `row` is less than the length of our `inputArray`. Finally, our loop will increment by one.

Step 2: Our outer loop traverses through each row moving horizontally to the right through each row. We now need to traverse through each column. We can do that with a nested `for` loop. Create a counter, `column`, of type `int` and set it to a value of `0`. We want to check the condition that our counter, `column`, is less than the length of the current `row` we are iterating through. Finally, increment `column` by `1`.

Step 3: Now, that we have set up our outer loop to account for each row and inner loop evaluating each column in a row, it‚Äôs time to look for our `target`! Inside our nested loop, create an `if` statement that checks if `target` is equal to the input array at our current `row` and `column`. Since we are comparing `String`s, be sure to use the `.equals()` method. If it is found, add this line of code: `System.out.println(target + " located at [" + row + "][" + column + "].");`. Also, be sure to return `1` to end our search.

Step 4: If we finish searching our matrix and the `target` value is not found, add this line of code: `System.out.println("Couldn't find the " + target + " in the haystack.");` and return `-1`.

Great job! Try changing your `target` in the `main()` method from a `"needle"` to `"four leaf clover"` and notice the output in the terminal.

**Conclusion:**

As we have discussed, linear search works best on small lists because searching sequentially from the beginning could be dangerously slow. If the value we are looking for is at the end of the list (or not in the list at all), and the list is huge, you can see why it is not considered the most efficient search algorithm.

Another shortcoming is the fact that it only returns a single value. If there were two needles in our haystack, we would have no way of knowing ‚Äî our method stops after finding the first one.

Finally, Linear search is a good choice for a search algorithm when you expect the target value to be positioned near the beginning of the list. There are faster searching algorithms for lists that are already sorted, but it also takes time to sort a list. If you have an unsorted list, and don‚Äôt have time to sort it, linear search is a good option.
