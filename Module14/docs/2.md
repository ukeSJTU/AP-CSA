# Linear Search with 1D and 2D Arrays

In this article, we will implement Linear Search on both 1D and 2D arrays. Linear search is used to search for a target value in a list by checking each element one by one until a match is found. If a match is found, the index is returned; otherwise, a message indicates the target was not found.

Keep in mind that linear search is ideal for short lists but inefficient for large datasets because it searches sequentially. If the target is at the end of the list or doesn't exist, the process can be very slow.

## Linear Search Implementation

Linear search starts with the first element and checks if it matches the target, continuing until a match is found. The steps are:

1. Examine the current element in the list.
2. If the current element equals the target value, stop.
3. If not, check the next element in the list.
4. Continue steps 1-3 until the element is found or the end of the list is reached.

### Linear Search Example

Given the list: `[45, 17, 23, -19, 43, 55, 72, -44, 17]`, we can use linear search to find the target value `72`. The algorithm moves through the list until it finds `72` at the 6th position.

Here is the pseudocode for linear search as a method:

```pseudo
for each element in the search_list
    if element equals target value then
       print location and return index
if element is not found then
    print message not found and return -1
```

## Linear Search on 1D Array

Let's implement linear search on a 1D array in Java. Consider a `LinearSearch` class with a `main()` method containing an input array `arr` and a target value `target`. We call a `linearSearch()` method with these as arguments.

Steps to write the `linearSearch()` method:

1. Create a method `linearSearch()` that returns an `int` and takes two parameters: `int[] arr` (the array to search) and `int target` (the value to find).
2. Inside the method, use a `for` loop with a counter `i` starting at `0`, running as long as `i` is less than the array length, incrementing by `1` each iteration.
3. Within the loop, check if the element at index `i` equals `target`. If so, print "Element is present at index \_" and return the index to exit the method.
4. If no match is found, after the loop, print "Element is not present in the array" and return `-1`.

Here is the implementation:

```java
class LinearSearch {
  public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if(arr[i] == target) {
        System.out.println("Target " + target + " found at: " + i);
        return i;
      }
    }
    System.out.println("Target " + target + " not found.");
    return -1;
  }
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 };
    int target = 10;
    linearSearch(arr, target);
  }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Target 10 found at: 3
```

### Application: Searching for Allergens

Imagine you have a food allergy and need to search a product's ingredient list. Let's adapt the linear search to find a string in an array of strings.

Complete the `linearAllergyFoodSearch()` method to search for an allergen:

```java
class LinearSearch {
  public static int linearAllergyFoodSearch(String[] arr, String allergy) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (allergy.equals(arr[i])) {
        System.out.print("I found " + allergy + " listed as ingredient " + (i + 1) + ".");
        return 1;
      }
    }
    System.out.print("Element is not present in ingredients");
    return -1;
  }
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    String[] arr = { "wheat", "honey", "sugar", "eggs", "nuts" };
    String allergy = "nuts";
    linearAllergyFoodSearch(arr, allergy);
  }
}
```

> Hint
> When comparing Strings, use the `.equals()` method instead of `==`.

## Linear Search on 2D Array

Now, let's apply linear search to 2D arrays. A 2D array in Java is an array of arrays. For example:

```java
double[][] values = {
  {1.5, 2.6, 3.7},
  {7.5, 6.4, 5.3},
  {9.8, 8.7, 7.6},
  {3.6, 5.7, 7.8}
};
```

Elements are accessed by row and column index, e.g., `values[1][2]` returns `5.3`. We traverse 2D arrays using nested loops, typically `for` loops to track indices:

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] twoDimensionalArray = {{0, 1, 2}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    for (int row = 0; row < twoDimensionalArray.length; row++) {
      for (int column = 0; column < twoDimensionalArray[row].length; column++) {
        System.out.print("Index [" + row + "][" + column + "]: ");
        System.out.println(twoDimensionalArray[row][column]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Index [0][0]: 0
Index [0][1]: 1
Index [0][2]: 2
Index [1][0]: 4
Index [1][1]: 5
Index [1][2]: 6
Index [2][0]: 7
Index [2][1]: 8
Index [2][2]: 9
```

### 2D Linear Search Example

Given a 2D array, we search for a value of `3`:

```java
int[][] ExampleInputArray = {{0, 12, 15}, {1, 3, 9}, {17, 11, 3}};
```

Visualized as a matrix:

```
[ 0, 12, 15]
[ 1,  3,  9]
[17, 11,  3]
```

We start with the first row, checking columns for `3`: comparing with `0`, `12`, and `15`. No match, so we move to the second row: `1`, `3`, `9`. A match is found at the second row, second column, i.e., `[1][1]`.

Pseudocode for 2D linear search:

```pseudo
for each row in the search_list
  for each column of that row
    if element at that row and column equals the target value then
      print the index of the row and column and return 1
print message that element is not found and return -1
```

### Application: Needle in a Haystack

Let's search for a "needle" in a 2D "haystack" array of strings. The `main()` method provides a 2D `haystack` array and a `target` set to `"needle"`.

Steps to implement `linearSearch2D()`:

1. Create a `for` loop with `row` starting at `0`, running while `row` is less than the array length, incrementing by `1`.
2. Inside, create a nested `for` loop with `column` starting at `0`, running while `column` is less than the current row's length, incrementing by `1`.
3. Within the nested loop, check if `target` equals the element at the current `row` and `column` using `.equals()`. If found, print the location and return `1`.
4. If not found after all iterations, print a message indicating the target wasn't found and return `-1`.

Here is the implementation:

```java
class LinearSearch2D {
  public static int linearSearch2D(String[][] haystack, String target) {
    for(int row = 0; row < haystack.length; row++) {
      for(int column = 0; column < haystack[row].length; column++) {
        if(haystack[row][column].equals(target)) {
          System.out.println(target + " located at [" + row + "][" + column + "].");
          return 1;
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println("Couldn't find the " + target + " in the haystack.");
    return -1;
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[][] haystack = {{"hay", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}, {"needle", "hay"}, {"hay", "hay"}};
    String target = "needle";
    linearSearch2D(haystack, target);
  }
}
```

**Output**:

```
needle located at [4][0].
```

Try changing the `target` in the `main()` method to `"four leaf clover"` to see the output when the target is not found.

## Conclusion

Linear search works best on small lists because searching sequentially can be slow if the value is at the end or not in the list, especially with large datasets. It also only returns the first match, missing any subsequent occurrences. However, it is a good choice when the target is expected near the beginning of the list or when dealing with unsorted lists, as sorting takes additional time.
