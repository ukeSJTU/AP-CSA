[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

into two virtual sub-lists. The first sub-list contains every element we’ve already sorted. The second sub-list, contains the elements that haven’t been sorted yet. This is the sub-list that we’ll be _selecting_ the smallest item from.

Here is the logic of the selection sort algorithm we are going to build. Please expand the narrative window to view

— it’s a bit hard to parse the indentation level otherwise:

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
 repeat (size - 1) times
  start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list as the current minimum
    walk through all elements of the unsorted sub-list to find the index of the smallest element and set as current minimum
  swap that element with the first element in the unsorted sub-list. That element is now part of the sorted sublist
end selectionSort
```

Initially, the sorted sub-list is empty and the unsorted sublist contains all the items.

Input array: `[2, 7, -7, 20, -5]`  
Sorted sub-list: empty  
Unsorted sub-list: `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`

Selection sort works by taking the smallest item in an unsorted sub-list and swaps it with the first unsorted position, making it part of the sorted sub-list.

We have to repeat the process of selecting the smallest item in the unsorted sub-list and moving it into the sorted sub-list once for every item in the unsorted sub-list.

The algorithm will be implemented with two loops. The first loop will run `size - 1` times because we have to do the process of selecting the smallest item in the list and moving it into the sorted sublist once for every item in the list. We have a `-1` here because we don’t have to do this for the very last item. If every other item in the list has been sorted, the last item is guaranteed to be sorted as well!

We will store the first position in the unsorted sub-list as our **current minimum**.

Input array: `[2, 7, -7, 20, -5]`  
Sorted sub-list: empty  
Unsorted sub-list: `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`  
Current minimum: **2**

The inner `for` loop will iterate through the unsorted sub-list `n` times making comparisons to find the smallest value in the unsorted sub-list.

For each comparison of **current minimum** to the remaining items in the unsorted sub-list, the algorithm will check :

If the unsorted number in comparison is less than our **current minimum**. If it is not, we keep going.

Unsorted sub-list `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`  
Current minimum: **2**  
Next unsorted element: 7 // Current minimum does not change

If a smaller number is found, set the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

as the new **current minimum** and continue to the end of the array.

Unsorted sub-list: `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`  
Current minimum: **2**  
Next unsorted element: -7 // Current minimum is -7

Unsorted sub-list: `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`  
Current minimum: **\-7**  
Next unsorted element: 20 // Current minimum does not change

Unsorted sub-list: `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`  
Current minimum: **\-7**  
Next unsorted element: -5 // Current minimum does not change

When we reach the end of comparisons in the unsorted sub-list the smallest element is selected and swapped with the first unsorted position, and that element is now considered a part of the sorted sub-list.

Original input array: `[2, 7, -7, 20, -5]`  
`2` swaps places with `-7`  
After swap: `[-7, 7, 2 20, -5]`

We can consider `-7` to be a part of the sorted sub-list and `2` to be a part of the unsorted sub-list.

We’ll have to keep track of where the boundary between our unsorted sub-list and sorted sub-list is. Now that we’ve sorted one element, that boundary has moved to the right by one giving us a new **current minimum**.

Unsorted sub-list: `7, 2, 20, -5`  
Current minimum: **7**

We would then find the next minimum element `-5` and swap it to the new start of the unordered list.

Original input array: `[2, 7, -7, 20, -5]`  
`-5` swaps places with `7`  
After two swaps: `[-7, -5, 2 20, 7]`

We will repeat the process until we have reached the last element in our input array which we will consider to be sorted by the time we have reached it.

Let’s consider how much work this

does in order to sort the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

. What do we mean by work? Let’s count how many operations this algorithm does! We’ll consider any time we compare two number to be one operation.

This algorithm makes a lot of comparisons using our two `for` loops! Given our sample data `[2, 7, -7, 20, 5]` on our first pass, we are going to make four comparisons.

`2` will first be compared to `7`. `2` is smaller. Then `2` will be compared to `-7`. `-7` becomes our smallest number. We’ll then compare `-7` to `20` and then again to `5`. We’ll make four total comparisons on this pass through the data.

On our next pass, the `-7` has already been sorted, so we only have four items in our unsorted sublist. We’ll have to make three comparisons to find the smallest. On our third pass there will be two comparisons and so on. When we add all of these up, for a list of size 5, that is a total of 10 comparisons.

While that doesn’t seem like a ton of comparisons, imagine the amount of comparisons we would need to make with ten pieces of data: `[2, 7, -7, 20, 5, -3, 5, 18, 4, -50]`. Our first pass alone would make nine comparisons. Now, imagine a hundred pieces of data!

In fact, when thinking about the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[runtime](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/runtime)

of algorithms, we only care about how they do on absurdly large lists (think infinitely long). It turns out that as we get larger and larger lists, the number of comparisons starts to approach `n^2` (where `n` is the length of the list).

We can see this happen in our example lists. With a list of size 5, we needed 10 comparisons. That’s pretty far away from 25 (5^2). When we have a list of size 10, we need to do 55 total comparisons. That’s getting closer to 10^2. We won’t go through the math here, but as n approaches infinity, the number of comparisons needed approaches `n^2`.

`n^2` comparisons is pretty bad. And the bad news keeps on coming! Some sorting algorithms can cut out some of their comparisons depending on the array they’re trying to sort. This isn’t the case for selection sort.

Consider the best case for this sorting algorithm: we give selection sort an already sorted array. Can selection sort cut out any comparisons? Unfortunately, the answer is no. We still need to look through all of our values to find the smallest value. It just so happens that we don’t need to swap it because it’s already in the right place.

Whether we’re given the best case, worst case, or any random list, selection sort will always make `n^2` comparisons.

Nested loops are generally an indicator of quadratic complexity. This means that as the number of elements `n` increases, the running time increases quadratically. This means that if `n` doubles, we know that sorting time will quadruple.

If you’re intimidated by all this math, just remember we need to make around `n` comparisons to find the smallest item in the array. And we need to do that `n` times. So we end up at a runtime of `n^2`.

Selection Sort

### Storing the Current Minimum Index in Unsorted Sub-List

7 min

Let’s remind ourselves of the pseudo-code for our selection sort algorithm:

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
 repeat (size - 1) times
  start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list as the current minimum
    walk through all elements of the unsorted sub-list to find the index of the smallest element and set as current minimum
  swap that element with the first element in the unsorted sub-list. That element is now part of the sorted sublist
end selectionSort
```

In this implementation of selection sort, we will write a `for` loop that runs the length of the input

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

minus `1`.

**Step 1:** Inside of the `for` loop we will set the _current minimum index_ to the first position of the unsorted sub-list.  
**Step 2:** We will look through the remainder of the unsorted sub-list to find the actual minimum

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

.  
**Step 3:** We will swap the actual minimum index value with the first unsorted position and now consider that position as part of the sorted sub-list.  
**Step 4:** We move on to the next unsorted item in the array and repeat steps 2 and 3.  
**Step 5:** We will continue to do this until we arrive at the last element in the list.

For this exercise, we will focus on the outer `for` loop iterating through our input array and setting the `currentMinimumIndex`.

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
...
 repeat (size - 1) times
  start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list as the current minimum
   ...
end selectionSort
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Inside of our `selectionSort()` function, create a variable `size` of type `int` and set to the length of our input array.

    Hint

    To find the length of an array we can use the `.length` property.

    ```
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};System.out.println(numbers.length}; // Prints: 4
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    To start sorting, we need to write a `for` loop that begins with a counter, `i`, initialized to `0`.

    If we have a list of size 5, we know that we need to find the smallest value 4 times (the 5th smallest value will already be sorted by default). Therefore, we want our outer for loop to run 4 times. Since our loop counter is starting at 0, we want it to end once it gets to 4. The condition is therefore `i < size - 1`.

    Hint

    Here is a reminder of `for` loop syntax in Java:

    ```
    for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {  // code block to be executed}
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Inside of our `for` loop, create a variable `currentMinimumIndex` of type `int` and assign it the value of `i`. Ultimately, we want to find the location of the smallest value in our unsorted sub-list and assign it to `currentMinimumIndex`.

Selection Sort

### Finding the Smallest Unsorted Element

6 min

Awesome, we have begun iterating through our input

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

and inside of our `for` loop have captured the first position in the unsorted sub-list and saved the value as `currentMinimumIndex`.

To review, here’s the skeleton we’re aiming for:

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
 repeat (size - 1) times
  start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list as the current minimum
    walk through all elements of the unsorted sub-list to find the index of the smallest element and set as current minimum
  swap that element with the first element in the unsorted sub-list. That element is now part of the sorted sublist
end selectionSort
```

Now, we will create another loop inside that visits each element in the unsorted sub-list after `currentMinimumIndex` for our comparisons. To do that we will want to have our counter start at the value of `i + 1`. We want to stop once we’ve reached the end of our unsorted sub-list, which is the last item in the input array. Here is how we might use a nested loop to make our comparisons:

```
int arr[] = {30, 50, 10, 70};for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {  System.out.println(“Outer loop unsorted position “ + i);  for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {    System.out.println(“i = “ + i + “; j = “ + j);  }}
```

Output:

```
Outer loop unsorted position 1i = 30; j = 50i = 30; j = 10i = 30; j = 70Outer loop unsorted position 2i = 50; j = 10i = 50; j = 70Outer loop unsorted position 3i = 10 ; j = 70
```

Let’s add some logic to our code in **SelectionSort.java** file that will compare our element at the first position in the unsorted sub-list with the rest of the items in the sub-list and set `currentMinimumIndex` to the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[index](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/index)

of the element with the smallest value. Remember, we are saving the _index_ of the element to use for the swap, not the value.

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
 ...
  start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list
  walk through all elements of the unsorted sub-list to find the index of the smallest element
  ...
end selectionSort
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Inside of our `for` loop, but after `currentMinimumIndex`, create a nested `for` loop with a counter `j` set equal to `i + 1`, that loops through the remainder of our input array, checking the condition that `j` is less than `size`.

    Hint

    Here is a reminder of `for` loop syntax in Java:

    ```
    for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {  // code block to be executed}
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside of the `for` loop we added, create an `if` statement that checks if the value at index `j` in our input array is less than the value of our input array at index `currentMinimumIndex`.

    Hint

    To get the value of an array at a specific index we can use bracket notation:

    ```
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};// Print item at index 2System.out.println(numbers[2]); // Prints: 3
    ```

    If statement syntax:

    ```
    if (5 > 4) {  // execute code}
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    If the condition is true then set the new `currentMinimumIndex` to `j`.

    Hint

    ```
    if (arr[j] < arr[currentMinimum]) {  // execute code}
    ```

Selection Sort

### Selection Sort: Swap

12 min

As mentioned, the selection sort

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[algorithm](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm)

swaps the element in the first position of the unsorted sub-list with the element with the lowest value in the remainder of the unsorted sub-list.

How does this algorithm swap these elements in practice? Let’s say we have the two values stored at the following indices `index_1` and `index_2`. How would we swap these two elements within the list?

It is tempting to write code like:

```
array[index_1] = array[index_2];array[index_2] = array[index_1];
```

However, if we do this, we lose the original value at `index1`. The element gets replaced by the value at `index2`. Both indices end up with the value at `index2`.

Programming languages have different ways of avoiding this issue. In some languages, we create a temporary variable which holds one element during the swap:

```
int temp = array[index_1];array[index_1] = array[index_2];array[index_2] = temp;
```

This animation illustrates how the swapping in the selection sort algorithm should work:

![](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/sorting/swap.gif)

Using the temporary variable strategy seen in the GIF above avoids the loss of any of the values whose position we need to exchange.

We’ll use this strategy to build out `swap()`.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Look at the `swap()` method. Notice that `swap()` takes 3 arguments: `arr`, the input array, and `indexOne`, and `indexTwo`, the two indices whose values we want to swap.

    In the method, create an `int` variable called `temp` and store the value of the element at the `indexTwo` position in the input array so it can be referenced later.

    Hint

    We can use bracket notation to access an element at a specific position in an array.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Change the value at `indexTwo` of the input array to the value of the element at `indexOne`.

    Hint

    We can use bracket notation to access an element at a specific position in an array.

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Set the element at `indexOne` of the array to the original value of the element at `indexTwo` by referring to the `temp` variable we created earlier (the element at indexTwo is no longer the same after the previous step).

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    In the `main()` method, let’s test out the swap method. Add the following code to the `main()` method:

    ```
    int[] swapData = {-10, 15, 18, 10, 25};// provide arguments for `swap()`SelectionSort.swap();
    ```

    Check out the array called `swapData`. Call `swap()` so that the values `15` and `10` swap places with each other. We will print the results in our next checkpoint!

    Hint

    `swap()`‘s first argument should be the array, the second argument should be the first index (index of the element `15`), the third argument should be the second index to swap (index of element `10`). Make sure to pass in the index, not the actual element!

5.  Checkpoint 5 Passed

    5.

    Add a print statement in the main method right after the `swap()` call. To print an array use `System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arrayName))`. Make sure to use the correct variable name of your array.

    Hint

    Use `System.out.println(Arrays.toString(swapData));` to print out the array example.

6.  Checkpoint 6 Passed

    6.

    Now that we know our `swap()` method works, let’s add it to our `selectionSort()` method.

    Update the code executed in our `main()` method to:

    ```
    int[] data = { 2, 7, -7, 20, -5 };SelectionSort.selectionSort(data);System.out.println("Sorted Array in Ascending Order: ");System.out.println(Arrays.toString(data));
    ```

    Next, in our `selectionSort()` method, after our inner `for` loop but before we close our outer `for` loop, call the `swap()` method passing in `arr`, `i` and `currentMinimumIndex`.

### Selection Sort Review

1 min

Great job! You have finished the selection sort

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[algorithm](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm)

. Let’s take a final look at what you did.

We found the smallest element in our

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/array)

and then swapped it with the first element in our array, if the first element wasn’t already the smallest value. Next, we found the second smallest element, and swapped it with the second element in the list. This process keeps going till we are looking at the last item in the array, and there’s no sorting left to do.

This is where selection sort gets its name from: one item at a time we are selecting the smallest item, and moving it to it’s “sorted” position.

While selection sort is a fine algorithm to use on small arrays it doesn’t perform well on larger data sets as ours is built with a nested `for` loop. This is generally a sign of quadratic complexity and in the case of selection sort we find that best, worst and average case are an `O(n^2)`.

Instructions

Here we have our finished code from the last exercise. Go ahead and run the code again to see the results!

Try changing the data provided to the input array, `data`. What happens when you provide just one or no values?

Does your selection sort algorithm run on an array of string values? You’ll have to change some variable types to make this work — right now, all of our methods are expecting `int[]`s, but we’d want `String[]`s. Also, comparison operators like `<` and `>` don’t work with Strings. Instead, take a look at the [compareTo()](<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)>) documentation to see how to compare Strings.

Want another challenge?

Imagine that you have been given the instructions to change selection sort to order the elements in descending, rather than ascending order? Can you do it?

If you need a hint, take a look at the `if` statement within the `selectionSort()` function. Also, while it is not required to accomplish this task, you might want to rename `currentMinimumIndex` to `currentMaximumIndex` for human readability!
