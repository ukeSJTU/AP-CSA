# Selection Sort: Conceptual and Implementation

## Introduction to Selection Sort

Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It gets its name by **selecting** the smallest item that hasn't been sorted yet and placing it in the correct position. It works by dividing the input array into two virtual sub-lists:

-   The first sub-list contains every element already sorted.
-   The second sub-list contains the elements that haven't been sorted yet, from which we select the smallest item.

Here is the logic of the selection sort algorithm in pseudocode:

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
  repeat (size - 1) times
    start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list as the current minimum
    walk through all elements of the unsorted sub-list to find the index of the smallest element and set as current minimum
    swap that element with the first element in the unsorted sub-list. That element is now part of the sorted sublist
end selectionSort
```

Initially, the sorted sub-list is empty, and the unsorted sub-list contains all items. For example:

-   Input array: `[2, 7, -7, 20, -5]`
-   Sorted sub-list: empty
-   Unsorted sub-list: `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`

Selection sort takes the smallest item in the unsorted sub-list and swaps it with the first unsorted position, making it part of the sorted sub-list. This process repeats for each item in the unsorted sub-list.

The algorithm uses two loops:

-   The outer loop runs `size - 1` times because we process each item except the last one (which is guaranteed to be sorted if all others are).
-   The inner loop iterates through the unsorted sub-list to find the smallest value.

Initially, the first position in the unsorted sub-list is set as the **current minimum**:

-   Input array: `[2, 7, -7, 20, -5]`
-   Sorted sub-list: empty
-   Unsorted sub-list: `2, 7, -7, 20, -5`
-   Current minimum: **2**

The inner loop compares the **current minimum** with remaining items in the unsorted sub-list:

-   If the compared number is not smaller, the current minimum remains unchanged (e.g., `2` vs. `7`).
-   If a smaller number is found, update the **current minimum** to that index (e.g., `2` vs. `-7`, new minimum is `-7`).

After comparisons, the smallest element is swapped with the first unsorted position:

-   Original input array: `[2, 7, -7, 20, -5]`
-   `2` swaps with `-7`
-   After swap: `[-7, 7, 2, 20, -5]`

Now, `-7` is in the sorted sub-list, and the boundary moves, updating the **current minimum** to the next unsorted position. This repeats until the last element is reached, which is considered sorted by default.

## Algorithm Analysis

Let's analyze the work done by selection sort by counting comparisons as operations. For an array like `[2, 7, -7, 20, 5]` (size 5):

-   First pass: 4 comparisons to find the smallest.
-   Second pass: 3 comparisons for the next smallest.
-   Third pass: 2 comparisons, and so on.
-   Total: 10 comparisons for size 5.

For larger arrays, the number of comparisons grows significantly. With a size of 10 (e.g., `[2, 7, -7, 20, 5, -3, 5, 18, 4, -50]`), the first pass alone requires 9 comparisons, totaling 45 comparisons. As the list size `n` increases, the number of comparisons approaches `n^2`.

In terms of runtime, selection sort has quadratic complexity (`O(n^2)`) in all cases—best, worst, and average. Even with an already sorted array (best case), it still makes `n^2` comparisons because it must check all values to confirm the smallest. Nested loops are a general indicator of this quadratic behavior: if `n` doubles, sorting time quadruples.

Simply put, we make around `n` comparisons to find the smallest item, and we do this `n` times, resulting in a runtime of `n^2`.

## Implementation: Storing the Current Minimum Index

Let's implement selection sort by focusing on the outer loop and setting the `currentMinimumIndex`. The pseudocode focus is:

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
  repeat (size - 1) times
    start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list as the current minimum
    ...
end selectionSort
```

Steps in Java:

1. Inside `selectionSort()`, create a variable `size` of type `int` set to the length of the input array.
2. Write a `for` loop with counter `i` starting at `0`, running while `i < size - 1` (since the last element sorts itself).
3. Inside the loop, create `currentMinimumIndex` of type `int` and assign it the value of `i`, representing the first position of the unsorted sub-list.

## Implementation: Finding the Smallest Unsorted Element

Next, we add a nested loop to find the actual smallest element in the unsorted sub-list after `currentMinimumIndex`. The pseudocode focus is:

```pseudo
selectionSort(array)
  start at the beginning index of the unsorted sub-list
  walk through all elements of the unsorted sub-list to find the index of the smallest element
  ...
end selectionSort
```

Steps in Java:

1. Inside the outer `for` loop, after setting `currentMinimumIndex`, create a nested `for` loop with counter `j` set to `i + 1`, looping while `j < size` to check the rest of the unsorted sub-list.
2. Inside this nested loop, add an `if` statement to check if the value at index `j` is less than the value at `currentMinimumIndex`.
3. If true, update `currentMinimumIndex` to `j`, storing the index of the smallest value found so far.

## Implementation: Swapping Elements

Selection sort swaps the element at the first position of the unsorted sub-list with the smallest element found in the remainder of the unsorted sub-list. A naive swap like:

```java
array[index_1] = array[index_2];
array[index_2] = array[index_1];
```

fails because it overwrites the original value at `index_1`. Instead, use a temporary variable to hold one value during the swap:

```java
int temp = array[index_1];
array[index_1] = array[index_2];
array[index_2] = temp;
```

Steps in Java:

1. Define a `swap()` method that takes `arr` (input array), `indexOne`, and `indexTwo` (indices to swap).
2. Create an `int` variable `temp` to store the value at `indexTwo`.
3. Set the value at `indexTwo` to the value at `indexOne`.
4. Set the value at `indexOne` to `temp`.
5. In `selectionSort()`, after the inner loop, call `swap(arr, i, currentMinimumIndex)` to swap the first unsorted position with the smallest element's position.

Here is the complete implementation:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class SelectionSort {
  public static void selectionSort(int arr[]) {
    int size = arr.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
      int currentMinimumIndex = i;
      for (int j = i + 1; j < size; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < arr[currentMinimumIndex]) {
          currentMinimumIndex = j;
        }
      }
      swap(arr, i, currentMinimumIndex);
    }
  }

  public static void swap(int[] arr, int indexOne, int indexTwo) {
    int temp = arr[indexTwo];
    arr[indexTwo] = arr[indexOne];
    arr[indexOne] = temp;
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int[] data = { 2, 7, -7, 20, -5 };
    SelectionSort.selectionSort(data);
    System.out.println("Sorted Array in Ascending Order: ");
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(data));
  }
}
```

**Output**:

```
Sorted Array in Ascending Order:
[-7, -5, 2, 7, 20]
```

## Review

You've completed the selection sort algorithm. It works by selecting the smallest element and swapping it with the first unsorted position, repeating until the entire array is sorted. This is where selection sort gets its name: selecting the smallest item each time and moving it to its sorted position.

While effective for small arrays, selection sort doesn't perform well on larger datasets due to its nested `for` loops, indicating quadratic complexity. In all cases—best, worst, and average—it has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.

**Challenges**:

-   Try changing the input array in the code. What happens with one or no values?
-   Can selection sort work on an array of strings? Adjust variable types from `int[]` to `String[]` and use `compareTo()` for comparisons instead of `<` or `>` (refer to Java's `String.compareTo()` documentation).
-   Modify selection sort to order elements in descending order. Hint: Adjust the `if` condition in `selectionSort()` to find the largest value instead of the smallest, and consider renaming `currentMinimumIndex` to `currentMaximumIndex` for clarity.
