# Binary Search: Conceptual

## Introduction to Binary Search

With a sorted dataset, we can take advantage of the ordering to perform a search more efficiently than checking each element sequentially. Consider looking up the word "Telescope" in a dictionary. You wouldn't flip through pages starting from "A" and "B" until reaching "T" because you know "T" is near the end of the alphabet. Instead, you might open the dictionary near the end, see "R" words, jump ahead to "V" words, then go slightly backward to find "T" words.

At each point, you decide to look forward or backward based on the alphabet's ordering. This intuition forms the basis of an algorithm called _binary search_. Binary search requires a sorted dataset and follows these steps:

1. **Check the middle value of the dataset.**
    - If this value matches the target, return the index.
2. If the middle value is **less than the target**:
    - Repeat step 1 using the **right half** of the list.
3. If the middle value is **greater than the target**:
    - Repeat step 1 using the **left half** of the list.

This process continues until the target value is found or there are no more values to check in the list.

**Question**: What would be the benefit(s) of picking the middle value in a sorted list?

## Time Complexity of Binary Search

How efficient is binary search? In each iteration, the list is **cut in half**, resulting in a time complexity of `O(log N)`. For a sorted list of 64 elements, binary search will take **at most** `log2(64) = 6` comparisons.

In the worst case:

-   Comparison 1: Look at the middle of all 64 elements.
-   Comparison 2: If the middle is not the target, look at 32 elements.
-   Comparison 3: If the new middle is not the target, look at 16 elements.
-   Comparison 4: If the new middle is not the target, look at 8 elements.
-   Comparison 5: If the new middle is not the target, look at 4 elements.
-   Comparison 6: If the new middle is not the target, look at 2 elements.

When only 2 elements remain, the target is either one or the other, so there are at most 6 comparisons for a list of size 64.

A sorted dataset significantly speeds up searching. Without ordering knowledge, we would use linear search, which takes `O(N)` time.
