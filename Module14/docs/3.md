With a sorted data-set, we can take advantage of the ordering to perform a search which is more efficient than going element by element.

Let’s say you were looking up the word “Telescope” in the

. You wouldn’t flip through the “A” words and “B” words, page by page until you got to the page you wanted because you know “T” is near the end of the alphabet.

You might flip it open near the end and see “R” words. Maybe then you jump ahead and land at “V” words. You would then go slightly backward to find the “T” words.

At each point, you knew to look forward or backward based on the ordering of the alphabet. We can use this intuition for an

called _binary search_.

Binary search requires a sorted data-set. We then take the following steps:

1.  **Check the middle value of the dataset.**

-   If this value matches our target we can return the

    .

1.  If the middle value is **less than our target**

-   Start at step 1 using the **right half** of the list.

1.  If the middle value is **greater than our target**

-   Start at step 1 using the **left half** of the list.

We eventually run out of values in the list or find the target value.

Instructions

What would be the benefit(s) of picking the middle value in a sorted list?

### Time Complexity of Binary Search

1 min

How efficient is binary search?

In each iteration, we are **cutting the list in half.** The time complexity is `O(log N)`.

A sorted list of `64` elements will take **at most** ` log``2``(64) = 6 ` comparisons.

In the worst case:

-   Comparison 1: We look at the middle of all `64` elements
-   Comparison 2: If the middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at `32` elements
-   Comparison 3: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at `16` elements
-   Comparison 4: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at `8` elements
-   Comparison 5: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at `4` elements
-   Comparison 6: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at `2` elements

When there’s `2` elements, the search value is either one or the other, and thus, there is at most `6` comparisons in a sorted list of size `64`.

Instructions

A sorted data-set speeds up searching by a significant amount!

Without any knowledge about the ordering, we would resort to a linear search taking `O(N)` time.
