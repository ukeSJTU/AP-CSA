# Binary Search: Iterative and Recursive Implementations

In this article, we will implement Binary Search using both iterative and recursive approaches. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target is found or determined to be absent.

With a sorted dataset, we can leverage the ordering for a more efficient search than checking elements one by one, as in linear search. Consider guessing a number between 1 and 100 with only four guesses. If you start with 1 and get "higher" feedback, you're left guessing between 2 and 100 with three guesses. A better strategy is binary search: guess 50 first. If told "higher", guess 75 next. If told "lower", you're now guessing between 51 and 74 with two guesses left, significantly narrowing the range.

Binary search only works on sorted lists. Feedback like "higher" or "lower" wouldn't help with an unsorted list since it wouldn't indicate which part to search next.

## Binary Search Implementation Steps

Binary search requires a sorted dataset and follows these steps:

1. **Check the middle value of the dataset.**
    - If this value matches the target, return the index.
2. If the middle value is **less than the target**:
    - Repeat step 1 using the **right half** of the list.
3. If the middle value is **greater than the target**:
    - Repeat step 1 using the **left half** of the list.

This continues until the target is found or no values remain to check. When finding the "middle element" in a list with an even number of elements, take the smaller of the two middle indices.

### Example

To find the number `27` in the sorted list `[3, 4, 12, 17, 22, 27, 28, 36, 50]`:

-   Check the middle value, `22`. Since `22 != 27` and `27 > 22`, look at the right half: `[27, 28, 36, 50]`.
-   Check the middle value, `28`. Since `27 != 28` and `27 < 28`, look at the left item: `[27]`.
-   Check the middle value, `27`. Since `27 = 27`, return the index of `27`.

## Recursive Approach

Recursion involves a method calling itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems until a base case is reached. As a computer science joke goes, "to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion." Let's explore a recursive binary search solution.

Recursion is useful for problems requiring repeated actions until a condition (base case) is met. It often results in fewer lines of code and can be easier to understand than loops. In programming, recursion means a method invokes itself within its body. The recursive step calls the method with arguments that approach the base case.

### Implementation Steps in Java (Recursive)

The `binarySearch()` method accepts:

-   `arr`: the sorted array.
-   `left`: the starting index.
-   `right`: the ending index.
-   `target`: the value to find.

Steps:

1. Calculate the midpoint index `mid` as `(left + right) / 2`.
2. **Base Case 1**: If `target` equals `arr[mid]`, return `mid`.
3. **Recursive Cases**:
    - If `target < arr[mid]`, recursively call `binarySearch()` on the left half (`left` to `mid - 1`).
    - If `target > arr[mid]`, recursively call `binarySearch()` on the right half (`mid + 1` to `right`).
4. **Base Case 2**: If `left > right`, the search space is exhausted; return `-1`.

Here is the implementation:

```java
class BinarySearch {
  public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int left, int right, int target) {
    if (left > right) {
      return -1;
    }
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (target == arr[mid]) {
      return mid;
    }
    if (target < arr[mid]) {
      return binarySearch(arr, left, mid - 1, target);
    }
    if (target > arr[mid]) {
      return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, right, target);
    }
    return -1; // This line is technically unreachable due to the conditions above.
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = { 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 };
    int target = 8;
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    int index = binarySearch(arr, left, right, target);
    if (index != -1) {
      System.out.println("Element found at index " + index);
    } else {
      System.out.println("Element not found in the array");
    }
  }
}
```

Recursion is ideal for actions repeated until a stopping point (base case) is reached, as shown in this binary search implementation.

## Iterative Approach

An iterative solution repeats a set of instructions in a loop until a condition is met. Let's implement binary search iteratively.

### Implementation Steps in Java (Iterative)

The `binarySearch()` method accepts:

-   `arr`: the sorted array.
-   `target`: the value to find.

Steps:

1. Initialize `left` to 0 (start of array) and `right` to `arr.length - 1` (end of array).
2. Use a `while` loop that continues as long as `left <= right` (search space has at least one element). If the loop ends, return `-1` (target not found).
3. Inside the loop, calculate `mid` as `(left + right) / 2`. If `target == arr[mid]`, return `mid`.
4. Adjust the search space:
    - If `target < arr[mid]`, set `right = mid - 1` to search the left half.
    - If `target > arr[mid]`, set `left = mid + 1` to search the right half.

Here is the implementation:

```java
class BinarySearch {
  public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
      int mid = (left + right) / 2;
      if (target == arr[mid]) {
        return mid;
      }
      if (target < arr[mid]) {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
      if (target > arr[mid]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = { 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 };
    int target = 6;
    int index = binarySearch(arr, target);
    if (index != -1) {
      System.out.println("Element found at index " + index);
    } else {
      System.out.println("Element not found in the array");
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Is there a significant benefit to choosing one approach over the other? Both recursive and iterative implementations of binary search have the same time complexity of `O(log N)`. However, they differ in space usage. The recursive version has a space complexity of `O(log N)` due to the call stack, while the iterative version has a space complexity of `O(1)`, giving it a slight edge in memory efficiency.

Binary search is an excellent algorithm to understand recursion. Compare the steps in the recursive and iterative solutions to identify similarities and deepen your understanding of both approaches.
