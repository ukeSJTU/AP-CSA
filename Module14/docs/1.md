# Linear Search: Conceptual

## Introduction to Linear Search

Imagine you are a DJ at a party with a playlist for the event. A party guest wants to know if "Uptown Funk" by Bruno Mars is on your playlist. You would scan the entire playlist and find that it is not there. Another guest asks about "Single Ladies" by Beyonce, and you scan the list until you locate it as the fifth song, informing the guest accordingly.

In computer science, search algorithms are step-by-step procedures used to locate and retrieve information from a set of data. The method in the example is similar to a search algorithm called linear search.

The _linear search_, or sequential search, algorithm sequentially checks whether a given value is an element of a specified list by scanning the elements one-by-one. It checks every item in the list from beginning to end until it finds a target value. If the target value is found, the algorithm stops and returns its position in the list. If not found, it returns a message stating the target value is not in the list.

**Question**: How many songs would you need to check to find "Quimbara" by Celia Cruz in the playlist?

## Finding Elements in Lists

Linear search can be used to search for a desired value in a list by examining each element and comparing it with the search element, starting from the first element to the last until a match is found.

The steps are:

1. Examine the first element of the list.
2. If the first element is equal to the target value, stop.
3. If not, check the next element in the list.
4. Continue steps 1-3 until the element is found or the end of the list is reached.

For example, linear search can be used to find the target value 22 in a list, iteratively moving through until it finds 22 in the 7th position.

**Question**: Use linear search to find 23 in the list of numbers. It appears twice. Would linear search stop at the third element or the ninth element of the list?

## Best Case Performance

Linear search is not considered the most efficient search algorithm, especially for large lists. However, it is a great choice if you expect to find the target value at the beginning of the list or if the list is small.

The best case performance for linear search occurs when the target value is in the first position of the list, requiring only one comparison. The time complexity in this case is O(1).

Consider visiting a new coffee shop for an espresso. Unfamiliar with their menu, you use linear search to scan it. You efficiently find your desired drink because it was at the top of the menu.

**Question**: How many comparisons were made to find 'espresso' on the drink menu?

## Worst Case Performance

There are two worst cases for linear search:

-   **Case 1**: The target value is at the end of the list.
-   **Case 2**: The target value does not exist in the list.

In both cases, the algorithm must scan the entire list of N elements, making N comparisons. Therefore, the time complexity in the worst case is O(N).

Imagine searching through crates of vinyl records for a favorite musician. The worst case would be if the record is the last one in the crate or not there at all, requiring a full search.

**Question**: In one of the worst cases, the target value is found. Is this case more efficient than the second case because it was able to find the target value in the list?

## Average Case Performance

If linear search is used repeatedly on different lists, some searches will be the best case, some the worst, and most will be in between. On average, the target would be in the middle of the list, taking O(N/2) time.

To calculate the average case performance, consider that each element requires a different number of comparisons. The first element needs one comparison, the second needs two, and so on, up to N comparisons for the last element. The average number of comparisons is calculated using a specific formula, resulting in an average case time complexity of O(N/2), which simplifies to O(N) based on Big O rules.

**Question**: How would you calculate the average case performance of the given list?

## Time Complexity of Linear Search

Linear search runs in linear time, with the number of comparisons increasing linearly as the size of the list, N, increases. The time complexity in Big-O notation is O(N), meaning the number of comparisons is proportional to the number of elements. With a list twice as large, linear search will take at most twice as long. The time complexity also depends on the best, worst, and average case scenarios.

**Question**: What is an example where linear search would be a good choice to search for values? What is an example where it would be a bad choice?

## Review

**Congratulations!** You have learned how linear search works and how to use it to search for values in lists.

Key points:

-   Linear search is a search algorithm that sequentially checks whether a given value is an element of a specified list by scanning one-by-one until it finds the target value.
-   The time complexity for linear search is O(N), with performance dependent on:
    -   **Best Case**: Requires only 1 comparison if the target value is in the first position.
    -   **Worst Case**: Requires N comparisons if the target value is in the last position or does not exist.
    -   **Average Case**: Makes N/2 comparisons on average.
-   Linear search is a good choice when:
    -   The target value is expected near the beginning of the list.
    -   Searching an unsorted list, as it traverses the entire list regardless of order.
