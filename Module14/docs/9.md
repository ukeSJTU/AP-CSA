# Merge Sort: Conceptual Overview

## What Is Merge Sort?

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm created by John von Neumann in 1945. Its key innovation is the strategy of breaking the list-to-be-sorted into smaller parts, often referred to as a _divide-and-conquer algorithm_. In this approach, the data is continually divided into smaller elements until sorting them becomes straightforward.

Merge sort was the first of many algorithms to use this strategy and remains in use today in various applications.

**Question**: Why is separating a list into sublists beneficial for sorting speed?

## How Merge Sort Works

Merge sort operates in two main steps: splitting the data into smaller components called "runs," and recombining those runs into sorted lists through a process called "merging."

-   **Splitting**: The input array is divided in half. Each half is recursively split into quarters, and this process continues until each sublist contains only a single element.
-   **Merging**: Once the sublists are reduced to single elements, they are merged back together. When merging two single-element lists, compare the elements and return a two-element list with the smaller element first, followed by the larger one.

**Question**: How can we be sure that the leftover contents from two lists being merged are all larger than the result we've built so far?

## Merging Process

When merging larger pre-sorted lists, the process builds on the same principle used for single-element lists. Consider two sorted lists, `left` and `right`, which we want to combine into a single sorted list called `both`. We use two indices, `left_index` and `right_index`, to track positions in each list.

-   Initially, both indices point to the start of their respective lists, indicating the smallest elements of `left` and `right`.
-   Compare the elements at `left_index` and `right_index`. The smaller of the two becomes the next element in `both` since it's the smallest among the remaining elements of both lists.
-   Increment the index of the list from which the smaller element was taken to point to its next smallest element.
-   Repeat this comparison and selection process until one list is exhausted. Then, append the remaining elements of the other list to `both`, as they are guaranteed to be larger than all elements already added.

**Question**: Why is it important that we only merge pre-sorted lists?

## Merge Sort Performance

Merge sort is unique for its time in that the best, worst, and average time complexities are all the same: `Θ(n log n)`. This means an almost-sorted list takes the same amount of time as a completely out-of-order list. This consistency is acceptable because the worst-case scenario is as fast as a sorting algorithm can be for comparison-based sorting.

Some advanced sorts, like Timsort, improve upon merge sort by inspecting the input for pre-sorted "runs" to optimize performance. If the data is already sorted, Timsort achieves a runtime of `Θ(n)`.

Merge sort also requires additional space. Each separation needs a temporary array, so merge sort requires enough space to save the entire input a second time. This results in a worst-case space complexity of `O(n)`.

**Question**: Why does merge sort require so much space? Would it be possible to write an efficient sort that doesn't require additional space? What trade-offs would need to be made?
