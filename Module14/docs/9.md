created by John von Neumann in 1945. Merge sort’s “killer app” was the strategy that breaks the list-to-be-sorted into smaller parts, sometimes called a _divide-and-conquer algorithm_.

In a divide-and-conquer algorithm, the data is continually broken down into smaller elements until sorting them becomes really simple.

Merge sort was the first of many sorts that use this strategy, and is still in use today in many different applications.

Instructions

Why is it that separating a list into sublists makes sorting faster?

### How To Merge Sort:

1 min

Merge sorting takes two steps: splitting the data into “runs” or smaller components, and the re-combining those runs into sorted lists (the “merge”).

When splitting the data, we divide the input to our sort in half. We then recursively call the sort on each of those halves, which cuts the halves into quarters. This process continues until all of the lists contain only a single element. Then we begin merging.

When merging two single-element lists, we check if the first element is smaller or larger than the other. Then we return the two-element list with the smaller element followed by the larger element.

Instructions

How can we be sure that the leftover contents from two lists that we’re merging are all larger than the result we’ve built so far?

### Merging

2 min

When merging larger pre-sorted lists, we build the list similarly to how we did with single-element lists.

Let’s call the two lists `left` and `right`. Both `left` and `right` are already sorted. We want to combine them (to _merge_ them) into a larger sorted list, let’s call it `both`. To accomplish this we’ll need to iterate through both with two indices, `left_index` and `right_index`.

At first `left_index` and `right_index` both point to the start of their respective lists. `left_index` points to the smallest element of `left` (its first element) and `right_index` points to the smallest element of `right`.

Compare the elements at `left_index` and `right_index`. The smaller of these two elements should be the first element of `both` because it’s the smallest of both! It’s the smallest of the two smallest values.

Let’s say that smallest value was in `left`. We continue by incrementing `left_index` to point to the next-smallest value in `left`. Then we compare the 2nd smallest value in `left` against the smallest value of `right`. Whichever is smaller of these two is now the 2nd smallest value of `both`.

This process of “look at the two next-smallest elements of each list and add the smaller one to our resulting list” continues on for as long as both lists have elements to compare. Once one list is exhausted, say every element from `left` has been added to the result, then we know that all the elements of the other list, `right`, should go at the end of the resulting list (they’re larger than every element we’ve added so far).

Instructions

Why is it important that we only merge pre-sorted lists?

### Merge Sort Performance

2 min

Merge sort was unique for its time in that the best, worst, and average time complexity are all the same: `Θ(N*log(N))`. This means an almost-sorted list will take the same amount of time as a completely out-of-order list. This is acceptable because the worst-case scenario, where a sort could stand to take the most time, is as fast as a sorting

can be.

Some sorts attempt to improve upon the merge sort by first inspecting the input and looking for “runs” that are already pre-sorted. [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) is one such algorithm that attempts to use pre-sorted data in a list to the sorting algorithm’s advantage. If the data is already sorted, Timsort runs in `Θ(N)` time.

Merge sort also requires space. Each separation requires a temporary

, and so a merge sort would require enough space to save the whole of the input a second time. This means the worst-case space complexity of merge sort is `O(N)`.

Instructions

Why does merge sort require so much space? Would it be possible to write an efficient sort that doesn’t require any additional space? Can you think of any trade-offs that would need to be made?
