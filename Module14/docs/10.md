## Questions

What is the base case for _merge sort_, when the function does not recurse?

## Answer Choices

-   When _merge sort_ is passed a list where the first element is less than the second element.
-   When _merge sort_ has divided the input list evenly.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    When _merge sort_ is passed an empty or single element list as the argument.

    👏

    Correct! The base case ensures we’re passing “sorted” lists to the _merge_ sub-routine.

What is the time complexity of merge sort?

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    O(N \* log(N))

    👏

    Correct! In all cases merge sort performs in `O(N * log(N))` time.

-   O(N2)
-   O(N)

## Questions

Merge sort will mutate, or alter, the original list passed in as the argument.

## Answer Choices

-   True.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    False.

    👏

## Questions

In the _merge_ sub-routine, how do we combine two sub-lists into a single sorted list?

## Answer Choices

-   By dividing the sub-lists into a single element.
-   By looping as long as both sub-lists have elements, comparing the first element of one sub-list with every element of the other sub-list, and transfering the smallest element to a result list.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    By looping as long as both sub-lists have elements, comparing their first element, and transfering the smaller element to a result list.

    👏

    Correct! The _merge_ sub-routine is a linear operation because it only inspects and compares the first element of the list.

## Questions

What is always true of the sub-lists passed as arguments to _merge_?

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    They are sorted.

    👏

    Correct! By using already sorted sub-lists, the _merge_ sub-routine can combine them into a single sorted list in `O(N)` time.

-   They contain only positive numbers.
-   They are equal in length.
-   They are not equal in length.

## Questions

What kind of algorithm is merge sort?

## Answer Choices

-   Reduce, reuse, recycle
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Divide-and-conquer

    👏

    Correct! Merge sort reduces its problem to smaller problems iteratively solves those by a process called a _divide-and-conquer_ algorithm.

-   Graph traversal

What are the two steps to a merge sort?

## Answer Choices

-   Analyze and address
-   Individual merge and galloping mode
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Split and merge

    👏

    Correct! First a merge sort splits the list up and then it merges the split lists.
