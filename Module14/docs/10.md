# Quiz: Merge Sort Conceptual

## Question 1: Base Case for Merge Sort

What is the base case for _merge sort_, when the function does not recurse?

**Correct Answer**: When _merge sort_ is passed an empty or single element list as the argument.

**Explanation**: The base case ensures that we're passing "sorted" lists to the _merge_ sub-routine. An empty or single-element list is inherently sorted, so no further recursion is needed.

## Question 2: Time Complexity of Merge Sort

What is the time complexity of merge sort?

**Correct Answer**: O(N \* log(N))

**Explanation**: In all cases—best, worst, and average—merge sort performs in `O(N * log(N))` time due to its divide-and-conquer strategy, which splits the list into halves and merges them efficiently.

## Question 3: Mutation of Original List

Merge sort will mutate, or alter, the original list passed in as the argument.

**Correct Answer**: False

**Explanation**: Merge sort creates many copies of the original list during the splitting and merging process, so there is no mutation of the original input list.

## Question 4: Combining Sub-Lists in Merge Sub-Routine

In the _merge_ sub-routine, how do we combine two sub-lists into a single sorted list?

**Correct Answer**: By looping as long as both sub-lists have elements, comparing their first element, and transferring the smaller element to a result list.

**Explanation**: The _merge_ sub-routine is a linear operation because it only inspects and compares the first element of each sub-list, transferring the smaller one to the result, ensuring efficiency.

## Question 5: Property of Sub-Lists in Merge

What is always true of the sub-lists passed as arguments to _merge_?

**Correct Answer**: They are sorted.

**Explanation**: By using already sorted sub-lists, the _merge_ sub-routine can combine them into a single sorted list in `O(N)` time, as it only needs to compare the smallest remaining elements of each sub-list.

## Question 6: Type of Algorithm

What kind of algorithm is merge sort?

**Correct Answer**: Divide-and-conquer

**Explanation**: Merge sort reduces its problem to smaller subproblems and iteratively solves them through a process called a _divide-and-conquer_ algorithm, splitting the list and merging the results.

## Question 7: Steps of Merge Sort

What are the two steps to a merge sort?

**Correct Answer**: Split and merge

**Explanation**: First, merge sort splits the list into smaller sublists, and then it merges these split lists back together in sorted order.
