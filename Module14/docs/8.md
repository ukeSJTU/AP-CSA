# Quiz: Insertion Sort in Java

## Question 1: Efficiency of Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is the most efficient of the comparison sorting algorithms.

**Correct Answer**: False

**Explanation**: Insertion sort is not the most efficient due to its nested loop structure, which results in a quadratic time complexity of `O(n^2)` in the average and worst cases. Other algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are generally more efficient.

## Question 2: Worst Case Scenario Runtime

Which of the following describes the worst-case scenario runtime for insertion sort when a provided list is in perfect reverse order?

**Correct Answer**: All `n` items that need to be inserted into the sorted section of the list will be compared to every item in the already sorted section of the list, making `n^2` comparisons.

**Explanation**: In the worst case, such as a reverse-ordered list, each new element must be compared with all elements in the sorted sub-list, leading to a quadratic number of comparisons (`n^2`).

## Question 3: Intermediate Steps of Insertion Sort

What are the correct intermediate steps when sorting the dataset `[15, 12, 40, -3]` with Insertion Sort?

**Correct Answer**: `[12, 15, 40, -3]` -> `[12, 15, 40, -3]` -> `[-3, 12, 15, 40]`

**Explanation**: Insertion sort builds the sorted sub-list one element at a time. First, `12` is inserted before `15`. Then, `40` is already in position, so no change. Finally, `-3` is inserted at the start by shifting all other elements.

## Question 4: Average Big O Runtime of Insertion Sort

What is the average Big O runtime of insertion sort?

**Correct Answer**: Quadratic - `O(n^2)`

**Explanation**: Insertion sort is implemented with nested loops that iterate through the elements of the input array, resulting in a quadratic runtime of `O(n^2)` on average due to the comparisons and shifts required.

## Question 5: Big O Complexity Across Cases

Average, best case, and worst case Big O for insertion sort are all `O(n^2)`.

**Correct Answer**: False

**Explanation**: In the best-case scenario, when the list is already sorted, the runtime of insertion sort is `O(n)` because each element requires only one comparison. The average and worst-case runtimes are `O(n^2)`.
