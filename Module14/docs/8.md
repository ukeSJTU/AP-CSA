## Questions

Insertion sort is the most efficient of the comparison sorting algorithms.

## Answer Choices

-   True.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    False.

    👏

    Correct! Insertion sort is a good introduction to algorithmic thinking and sorting in particular, but it is not the most efficient due to its nested loop str…

## Questions

Which of the following describes the worst case scenario runtime for insertion sort when a provided list is in perfect reverse order?

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    All `n` items that need to be inserted into the sorted section of the list will be compared to every item in the already sorted section of the list, making n^2 comparisons.

    👏

    Correct!

-   As each element gets picked for insertion into the sorted list, it will only take one comparison to find the correct place to insert the new item. `1` comparison will happen `n` times.

## Questions

What are the correct intermediate steps of the following data set when it is being sorted with the Insertion sort? `[15, 12, 40, -3]`

## Answer Choices

-   `[-3, 12, 40, 15]` -> `[-3, 12, 40, 15]` -> `[-3, 12, 15, 40]`
-   (Selected)Correct:

    `[12, 15, 40, -3]` -> `[12, 15, 40, -3]` -> `[-3, 12, 15, 40]`

    👏

    Correct!

-   `[12, 15, 40, -3]` -> `[12, 15, 40, -3]` -> `[12, 15, -3, 40]` -> `[12, -3, 15, 40]` -> `[-3, 12, 15, 40]`

## Questions

What is the average Big O runtime of insertion sort?

## Answer Choices

-   Constant - `(1)`
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Quadratic - `O(N^2)`

    👏

    Correct! Insertion sort is implemented with nested loops that iterate through the elements of the input array which results in a quadratic runtime.

-   Exponential - `O(2^N)`
-   Linear - `O(N)`

## Questions

Average, best case and worst case Big O for insertion sort are all O(n^2).

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    False.

    👏

    Correct! In the best case scenario, when the list to be sorted is in perfect order, the runtime of insertion sort is O(n).

-   True.
