# Project: A Basic Calculator

## Overview

-   **Objective**: Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java).
-   **Goal**: Create a simple arithmetic calculator using classes, methods, and objects.
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Add two integers
    -   Subtract two integers
    -   Multiply two integers
    -   Divide two integers
    -   Apply the modulo operator on two integers

# Project Requirements

## Key Tasks

-   Create a `Calculator` class with a constructor.
-   Implement methods for arithmetic operations:
    -   `add()`: Returns sum of two integers.
    -   `subtract()`: Returns difference of two integers.
    -   `multiply()`: Returns product of two integers.
    -   `divide()`: Returns quotient of two integers.
    -   `modulo()`: Returns remainder of two integers.
-   Define a `main()` method to test the calculator.

## Implementation Steps

-   Instantiate a `Calculator` object in `main()`.
-   Test methods with sample inputs (e.g., add 5 and 7, subtract 45 and 11).
-   Expected output for sample inputs:
    -   Addition (5, 7): 12
    -   Subtraction (45, 11): 34
-   Add comments to describe the program's purpose.

# Exploration and Improvement

-   **Suggestions for Enhancement**:
    -   Extend functionality to handle `double` values.
    -   Add error handling for division by zero.
    -   Implement additional operations (e.g., power, square root).
-   **Learning Opportunity**: Experiment with method overloading for different parameter types.
-   Refer to starter and solution code in:
    -   Starter: `../src/projects/BasicCalculator_Starter/`
    -   Solution: `../src/projects/BasicCalculator_Solution/`
