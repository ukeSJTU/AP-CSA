# Build A Droid

## Project Brief

### Objective

Study for the AP Computer Science A Exam (Java)

### Build A Droid

We’ve set up a robot workshop to build some droids. All that’s missing are the instructions on how to create the robots and what they’ll do.

Can we write a Java class to help?

We’ll need to define the state and behavior of the droids using instance fields and methods. Let’s get to work!

## Tasks

### Defining a Droid

1. Start by defining the class `Droid`. Don’t forget to include a `main()` method! You can leave it empty for now. We want a `Droid` object that has the following state:

    - name
    - battery level

    and the following behavior:

    - performing a task
    - stating its battery level

    > Hint: Here’s an example of defining a `Person` class with a `main()` method:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

2. Declare an instance field called `batteryLevel`. We want to store whole number values in this field.

    > Hint: Here’s an example of defining an instance field in `Person`:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

3. Declare another instance field called `name` which will store our droid’s name. What type should this be?

    > Hint: Since `name` will store the text of what we call the `Droid`, `String` would be best.

4. Create a constructor method for the `Droid` class. The method should have one parameter of `String droidName`.

    > Hint: Constructor methods are named after the class. Here’s an example in `Person` that has one parameter:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public Person(int yearsAlive) {
    >     }
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

5. Inside the constructor, assign the parameter value of `droidName` to the appropriate instance field. Set the value of `batteryLevel` to `100`. Every new instance of `Droid` will have a `batteryLevel` of `100`.

    > Hint: Here’s an example of assigning a value to an instance field in the `Person` constructor:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public Person(int yearsAlive) {
    >         age = yearsAlive;
    >     }
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

### Declaring Instances of Droid

6. Inside `main()`, create a `new` instance of `Droid` named `"Codey"`.

    > Hint: Here’s an example of creating an instance of `Person`:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public Person(int yearsAlive) {
    >         age = yearsAlive;
    >     }
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >         Person patrick = new Person(32);
    >     }
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > Don’t forget the `new` keyword!

7. Print out the variable using `System.out.println()`.

    > Hint:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public Person(int yearsAlive) {
    >         age = yearsAlive;
    >     }
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >         Person patrick = new Person(32);
    >         // printing the variable:
    >         System.out.println(patrick);
    >         // access the age field:
    >         System.out.println(patrick.age);
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

8. That output isn’t very informative! Define a `toString()` method within `Droid`. The return type is `String`. Inside `toString()`, `return` a string that introduces the `Droid` using their name. Something like “Hello, I’m the droid: droidNameHere”

    > Hint: Here’s an example of a `toString()` method for `Person`:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public String toString() {
    >         return "Hey there, I am " + age + " years old!";
    >     }
    >     public Person(int yearsAlive) {
    >         age = yearsAlive;
    >     }
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >         Person patrick = new Person(32);
    >         System.out.println(patrick);
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

### Doing Droid Things

9. Define a new method: `performTask()`. This method should have a single parameter: `String task`. This method does not return any value.

    > Hint: Here’s an example of defining a new method on `Person`:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public void greetAnother(String name) {
    >         System.out.println("Hey there, " + name);
    >     }
    >     public Person(int yearsAlive) {
    >         age = yearsAlive;
    >     }
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >         Person patrick = new Person(32);
    >         patrick.greetAnother("Laura");
    >         // prints: hey there, Laura
    >     }
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > `void` indicates there is no return value.

10. Inside `performTask()`, print a statement like “`name` is performing task: `task`“. For example, `codey.performTask("dancing");` will print:

    ```plaintext
    Codey is performing task: dancing
    ```

11. Performing tasks is hard work. After the print statement, set `batteryLevel` to be `10` less than it was before. We’ll need to reassign the instance field to be the current value minus 10.

    > Hint: Here’s an example of manipulating the `age` instance field:
    >
    > ```java
    > public class Person {
    >     int age;
    >     public void ageOneYear() {
    >         age = age + 1;
    >     }
    >     public Person(int yearsAlive) {
    >         age = yearsAlive;
    >     }
    >     public static void main(String[] args) {
    >         Person patrick = new Person(32);
    >         System.out.println(patrick.age);
    >         // 32
    >         patrick.ageOneYear();
    >         System.out.println(patrick.age);
    >         // 33
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

12. Have your `Droid` instance perform some tasks inside of `main()`.

    > Hint: For example, we had our instances do activities like “dancing” and “levitating”.
    >
    > ```java
    > codey.performTask("dancing");
    > margot.performTask("levitating");
    > ```

### Next Steps

13. Create new instances and play around with methods. Here are some ideas to get you started:

    -   Create a `energyReport()` method that prints the instance’s `batteryLevel`.
    -   Create another instance.
    -   Create a method `energyTransfer()` that exchanges `batteryLevel` between instances.
