# What Are Classes, Objects, and Methods?

# Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming

Let's take a look at what's coming up in the object-oriented programming section of this path.

Object-oriented programming is a common style of programming where you design your code to function like objects in the real world. In Java, understanding the basics of object-oriented programming is especially important because every piece of Java code that you write interacts with Objects and Classes.

In this section of the course, you'll learn the foundations of object-oriented programming, write your own Classes, create your own Objects, and finally dive into some of the most common built-in Java Classes.

Let's get started!
