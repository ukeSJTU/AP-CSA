# Introduction to Classes and Objects

This content introduces the concepts of classes and objects in object-oriented programming, emphasizing their importance in managing complex data structures.

## Key Concepts

-   **Data in Programming**: Discussion on the significance of data in programming and the limitations of basic data types when dealing with complex entities, such as students in a school.
-   **Need for Custom Data Types**: Highlighting the need for custom data types to represent complex data structures in programming.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

-   **Managing Complex Data**: The importance of OOP in managing complex data types, specifically focusing on creating a custom 'student' data type to model student information within a school program.
-   **Functionality**: The need for functionality in managing student data, such as marking attendance and changing grades.
-   **Class as a Blueprint**: Introduction to a class in OOP as a blueprint for defining new data types, including attributes and functionalities for the student data type.
-   **Attributes**: Attributes of the student class, such as name and GPA, which define the properties of the student entity being modeled.
-   **Functions**: Introduction of functions within the student class, like determining honors based on GPA and setting scholarship status.

## Classes and Objects

-   **Defining Attributes**: Discussion on defining various attributes of a student, such as year, GPA, and scholarship status.
-   **Instances as Objects**: Clarification that creating a class describes the data type, while actual student instances are created as objects.
-   **Student Objects**: Explanation of student objects as instances of the student class, each with specific attributes like name and GPA.
-   **Modeling Real-World Entities**: OOP facilitates the modeling of real-world entities, enabling functions to interact with these objects effectively, such as granting scholarships to students.
-   **Flexibility**: The flexibility of OOP allows for the modeling of various real-world objects, making it a popular approach in modern programming languages.
