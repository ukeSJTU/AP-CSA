[**class**](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/class)

is a template for creating objects in Java. Think of it as a blueprint for the representation of a real-world object. A class outlines the necessary components and how they interact with each other. For example, consider a program designed to monitor student test scores. This program can include classes such as `Student` and `Grade` to represent real-world entities of students and their grades. The `Student` class, representing a student, will have fields to store the student ID, all courses the student can enroll in, and several other fields that capture relevant information.

![Diagram of a generic software object](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/diagram%20of%20an%20object-01.png)

We represent each student as an instance, or object, of the `Student` class.

This is object-oriented programming: programs are built using objects.

Let’s consider another example: a savings account at a bank.

What are the relevant details of a savings account in a bank? How about these fields:

-   Name of the owner
-   Bank account number
-   Amount of money in the account

What should a savings account do? Let’s go with these functions:

-   Deposit money.
-   Withdraw money.

We can represent this data in a class called `SavingsAccount`.

Imagine two people each have a bank account. Each of their accounts will be represented by an instance of the `SavingsAccount` class.

Let’s explore how to define a class in Java. We will use a class called `Car` that represents a real-world car.

The `Car` class in Java is defined like so:

```
public class Car {   // Empty Java Class }
```

In this example, a class named `Car` is defined with the `public` keyword. We’ll discuss what the keyword `public` means in a later exercise. Inside the body of the class, we can add fields to represent relevant information and functions to represent how this class can interact with other objects. We will fill out this class in later exercises.

Let’s practice creating classes by creating a class to represent a store.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    In the code editor, create a `public` class called `Store`.

    Hint

    Here’s how we create a new class called `Animals`:

    ```
    public class Animals{ }
    ```

    Don’t forget to add the curly braces.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the `Store` class, create a method called `public void buyItems()`.

    Keep the method body empty for now.

    Hint

    You’ll need to define the method in between the curly braces of the `Store` class. Here’s an example of how we can create a method called `public void getNames()`:

    ```
    public void getNames(){ }
    ```

### Classes: Constructors

14 min

In Java, the constructor is a special type of

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

defined within the class, used to initialize fields when an instance of the class is created. The name of the constructor method must be the same as the class itself. Generally, the constructor is defined as `public`. Again, don’t worry about the meaning of the `public` keyword for now. We will discuss this in a later exercise.

Let’s look at an updated `Car` class, which includes a constructor.

```
public class Car {  // Constructor public Car() {    // instructions for creating a Car instance  }   }
```

In the following example, the Car instance is assigned to the variable ferrari:

```
Car ferrari = new Car();
```

In this example, we have created an instance of a `Car` class called `ferrari`.

After the assignment operator, (=), we call the constructor method, `Car()`, using the keyword `new` to indicate that we’re creating a new instance of the `Car` class. Omitting the new keyword causes an error.

**Keep Reading: AP Computer Science A Students**

If we print the value of the variable `ferrari` we would see its memory address: `Car@76ed5528` In the above example, our variable `ferrari` is declared as a reference data type rather than with a primitive data type like `int` or

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[`boolean`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/boolean)

. This means that the variable holds a reference to the memory address of an instance. During its declaration, we specify the class name as the variable’s type, which in this case is `Car`.

If we use a special value, `null`, we can initialize a reference-type variable without giving it a reference. If we were to assign `null` to an object, it would have a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[void](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/void)

reference because `null` has no value.

For example, consider the following code snippet where we create an instance of a `Car`, assign it a reference, and then set its value to null:

```
Car thunderBird = new Car(); System.out.println(thunderBird); // Prints: Car@76ed5528 thunderBird = null; // change value to null System.out.println(thunderBird); // Prints: null
```

It’s important to understand that using a null reference to call a method or access an instance variable will result in a `NullPointerException` error.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Create a constructor for the `Store` class that prints out the message “I am inside the Store constructor”.

    > Note: do not worry about the error requiring a `main()` method to be defined. The `main()` method is inside the **Main.java** file.

    Hint

    Remember that the constructor has the same name as the class name. In Java, we print messages using `System.out.println()`. Following is the example of printing the message “Making a shoe!”

    ```
    System.out.println("Making a shoe!");
    ```

    Make sure to place the print statement inside the curly braces of the constructor method `Store()`!

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the `main()` method of a separate class called **Main.java** (separate file), create an instance of the `Store` class and call it `newStore`.

    Hint

    We create new instances of a class by calling the constructor using the `new` keyword.

    For example, we had a class called `Animal`.

    ```
    public class Animal {  public Animal() {    // body of Animal constructor method  }  public static void main(String[] args) {    // declare variable type and name    Animal tiger;     // assign a new instance of Animal to tiger    tiger = new Animal();   } }
    ```

    It’s common practice to combine declaration and assignment into a single line:

    ```
    Animal tiger = new Animal();
    ```

### Classes: Instance Fields

6 min

A real car has characteristics such as brand, model, year, color, etc. In a Java object representing a car, these characteristics are represented by _instance fields_ or _instance variables_.

In the last exercise, we created an object, but our object has no characteristics! We’ll add characteristics to our class by including instance fields or instance

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

.

Let’s revisit the `Car` class example.

We want our `Car` objects to have different colors, so we declare an instance field called `color`. Instance variables are often characterized by their “has-a” relationship with the object. For example, a `Car` “has-a” color, “has-a” make, “has-a” model name, and “has-a” model year.

Think about what qualities other than color a car might have.

```
public class Car {  /*  declare fields inside the class  by specifying the type and name  */  public String color;  public int year;  public String modelName;  public String make;  public Car() {    /*     instance fields available in    scope of the constructor method    */  } }
```

Instance variables are specific to each instance of the class which means that each object created from the class will have its own copy of these variables. These fields can be set in the following three ways:

-   If they are `public`, they can be set like this `instanceName.fieldName = someValue;`
-   They can be set by class methods.
-   They can be set by the constructor

    Preview: Docs Loading link description

    [method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

    (shown in the next exercise).

Let’s practice this concept by adding characteristics to a class that represents a dog.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Inside the `Dog` class of **Dog.java**, add a field to represent a dog’s name. Call this field `name`. We leave it up to you to figure out the correct type of this field.

    Hint

    Instance fields are declared within the curly braces of the class but outside any method. For example, given the class `Car`:

    ```
    public class Car {   String color;   int year;   String modelName;   String make;   public Car() {   } }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the `Dog` class of **Dog.java**, add a field to represent a dog’s breed. Call this variable `breed`. We leave it up to you to figure out the correct type for this field.

    Hint

    Instance fields are declared within the curly braces of the class but outside any method. For example, given the class `Car`:

    ```
    public class Car {   String color;   int year;   String modelName;   String make;   public Car() {   } }
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Inside the `Dog` class of **Dog.java**, add a field to represent a dog’s weight in kg. Call this field `weight`. We leave it up to you to figure out the correct type of this field.

    Hint

    Instance fields are declared within the curly braces of the class but outside any method. For example, given the class `Car`:

    ```
    public class Car {   String color;   int year;   String modelName;   String make;   public Car() {   } }

### Classes: Constructor Parameters

10 min

In Java, parameters are placeholders that we can use to pass information to a

Preview: Docs A method is a small piece of code, usually defined in a class, that can be used outside the class and in other parts of the program.

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

.

Since the constructor is a method, we can include parameters to assign values to instance fields.

Here the `Car` constructor has a parameter: `String carColor`:

```
public class Car {   public String color;   // constructor method with a parameter   public Car(String carColor) {     // parameter value assigned to the field     color = carColor;   } }
```

Now, when we create a new instance of the `Car` class and pass in a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[string](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

value to the constructor, it will be stored in the

Preview: Docs A parameter is the name of a variable passed into a function. Parameters allow functions to accept inputs. An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value of the variable (also known as the parameter) passed into a function. Suppose we have a function called tripleThis(): js function tripleThis(x) { return x \* 3; } tripleThis(6);

[parameter](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/parameter)

`carColor`. Inside the constructor, we can use this passed value however we want. In our example, we assign the value stored in `carColor` to the instance field `color`.

A method can be characterized by its **signature**, which is the name, number of, and parameters of the method. In the above example, the signature is `Car(String carColor)`.

Later, we’ll learn how to pass values into a method!

There are two types of parameters: formal and actual. The parameter we defined in the above example, `String carColor,` is a formal parameter. We can think of them as

Preview: Docs Stores data that can be manipulated and referenced throughout the code.

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

that will store the data that is passed into a method. It specifies the type and name of the data.

We’ll learn about actual parameters in the next exercise.

For now, let’s practice working with constructor parameters.

**Keep Reading: AP Computer Science A Students**

A class can have multiple constructors. We can differentiate them based on their parameters. The signature helps the compiler to differentiate between different methods.

For example, here we have defined two constructors:

```
public class Car {   public String color;   public int mpg;   public boolean isElectric;   // constructor 1   public Car(String carColor, int milesPerGallon) {     color = carColor;     mpg = milesPerGallon;   }   // constructor 2   public Car(boolean electricCar, int milesPerGallon) {     isElectric = electricCar;     mpg = milesPerGallon;   } }
```

The first constructor has two parameters: `String carColor` and `int milesPerGallon`.

While the second one has these: `boolean electricCar` and `int milesPerGallon`.

The values will help the compiler to decide which constructor to use. For example, `Car myCar = new Car(true, 40)` will be created by the second constructor because the arguments match the type and order of the second constructor’s signature.

When we don’t define the constructor, the Java compiler creates a default constructor that assigns default values to an instance. Default values can be created by assigning values to the instance fields during their declaration:

```
public class Car {  public String color = "red";  public boolean isElectric = false;  public int cupHolders = 4;  public static void main(String[] args) {    Car myCar = new Car();    System.out.println(myCar.color); // Prints: red  } }
```

Notice that the color instance field of the `myCar` object will have a red value because we’ve already defined the default value during the declaration.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Add a formal parameter to the `Store()` constructor called `String product`.

    Hint

    We define parameters within the parentheses of the method. In the following example, the parameter `String breedType` is added to the constructor:

    ```
    public Dog {   String breed;   public Dog(String breedType) {   } }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the constructor, assign `product` parameter to the instance field `productType`.

    Hint

    Here’s how we can assign a value to an instance field inside of the Dog() constructor.

    ```
    public Dog {   String breed;   public Dog(String breedType) {     // assign instance field of breed to equal breedType parameter     breed = breedType;   } }
    ```

### Classes: Assigning Values to Instance Fields

Since the constructor now accepts a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[parameter](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/parameter)

, let’s see how we can use this constructor to create an instance of an object with initial values for its fields.

To use the constructor, we call it just as we would an ordinary

Preview: Docs A method is a small piece of code, usually defined in a class, that can be used outside the class and in other parts of the program.

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

and pass in values for the parameters. These values, known as **arguments**, will be used to initialize the instance fields of the created object.

Let’s revisit our previous example of the `Car` class.

```
public class Car {   public String color;   public Car(String carColor) {     // assign parameter value to instance field     color = carColor;   } }
```

In this case, when creating a specific instance of `Car` called `ferrari`, we pass the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[string](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

“red” as the value for the `carColor` parameter.

```
class Main{   public static void main(String[] args){   Car ferrari = new Car("red");   } }  
```

When passing in values to a constructor, just like an ordinary method, the type of the value must match the type of the parameter.

In the code, we pass the `String` value “red” to the constructor method call: `new Car("red")`. The parameter `carColor` of type `String` now refers to the value passed in during the method call, which is “red”.

The field `color` of the object `ferrari` now has a value of “red”.

Remember, that we can access the fields of an object by using the dot operator like so:

```
ferrari.color; // "red"
```

refers to the actual values passed during the method call while a parameter refers to the

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

declared in the method signature.

When we pass an argument, a copy of the argument value is passed to the parameter rather than the actual variables. This process of calling a method with an argument value is called a call-by-value.

For example, we passed the `String` value “red” as an argument, but a copy of this value is assigned to the parameter `carColor`.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Create a new instance of `Store` called `lemonadeStand` in the `main()` method of **Main.java** and pass “lemonade” as the argument.

    Hint

    Look at the following example, we can create an instance called fido with the `breedType` of “retriever”:

    ```
    public static void main(String[] args) {   Dog fido = new Dog("retriever"); }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the `main()` method, print the instance field `productType` from `lemonadeStand`.

    Hint

    We access the field of an instance using the dot operator.

    ```
    fido.breed;

### Classes: Multiple Fields

11 min

Objects are not limited to a single instance field. We can declare as many fields as necessary for our program’s requirements. To illustrate this, let’s add two more instance fields to our Car instances.

We’ll add a `boolean isRunning`, which represents whether the car engine is on or not, and an `int velocity`, which indicates the speed at which the car is traveling.

```
public class Car {   String color;   // new fields!   boolean isRunning;   int velocity;   // new parameters that correspond to the new fields   public Car(String carColor, boolean carRunning, int milesPerHour) {     color = carColor;     // assign new parameters to the new fields     isRunning = carRunning;     velocity = milesPerHour;   } }
```

```
Public class Main(){   public static void main(String[] args) {     // new values passed into the method call     Car ferrari = new Car("red", true, 27);     Car renault = new Car("blue", false, 70);     System.out.println(renault.isRunning); // false     System.out.println(ferrari.velocity); // 27   } }
```

Now, the constructor has two new parameters: `boolean carRunning` and `int milesPerHour`.

Remember, it’s important to pass the arguments in the same order as they are listed in the parameters.

```
// values match types, no error Car honda = new Car("green", false, 0); // values do not match types, error! Car junker = new Car(true, 42, "brown");
```

Let’s practice this concept!

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Let’s add more to our `Store` class.

    Add these two fields `int inventoryCount` and `double inventoryPrice` to `Store`.

    Hint

    In the following example, we declare an instance field breed within the class but outside any method:

    ```
    public class Dog {   // declare instance fields here   String breed;   public Dog(String breedType) {     // assign values to instance fields here     breed = breedType;   } }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Add two new parameters to the `Store` constructor method, `int count` and `double price`. The final order of the parameters should be `product`, `count`, `price`.

    For example, `product` is of type `String` because that value is assigned to the instance field `String productType`.

    Hint

    Here’s a Dog class constructor and instance fields:

    ```
    public class Dog {   String breed;   boolean isWagging;   int age;   public Dog(String breedType, boolean wagging, int dogYears) {     breed = breedType;     isWagging = wagging;     age = dogYears;   } }
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Inside the `Store` constructor, assign the parameter values to the appropriate instance fields.

    Hint

    Look at the following example:

    The value of the parameter `breedType` is assigned to the instance field breed.

    ```
    // assigning breedType parameter to breed instance field breed = breedType;
    ```

    Do the same with `count` and `price` for their respective instance fields.

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Now create another instance of `Store` called `cookieShop` in the `main()`method of **Main.java**.

    `CookieShop` has a product called “cookies”. It has 12 cookies to sell and each cookie costs 3.75.

    Hint

    Remember, we create an instance of the class like this:

    ```
    SomeClass someInstance = new SomeClass(someParam1, someParam2, someParam3);
    ```

Java: Introduction to Classes

### Classes: Review

4 min

Object-oriented programming revolves around classes and objects. The

[`class`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-structures/class)

is a fundamental concept of OOP and programs in Java are built with multiple classes and their objects.

Let’s review what we’ve learned throughout this lesson:

-   A class is a blueprint to create instances. It defines the state and behavior of these instances.
-   Every class has a special

    [method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

    called constructor which is invoked when a new object is created. Constructors initialize the state of newly created instances.

-   Instance fields define the characteristics of an object. We can declare them within a class but outside of any method or constructor.
-   We use the dot operator (.) to access the instance fields.
-   A program can have multiple classes, instances, and instance fields as per our program’s requirements.

Later, we will explore how a program can be made from multiple classes. For now, our programs have a single class.

```
public class Dog {  // instance field  public String breed;  // constructor method  public Dog(String dogBreed) {    // value of parameter dogBreed assigned to instance field breed    breed = dogBreed;  }}
```

```
  public static void main(String[] args) {     // create instance: use 'new' operator and invoke constructor     Dog fido = new Dog("poodle");       // fields are accessed using: the instance name, `.` operator, and the field name.     System.out.println(fido.breed);  // Prints "poodle"   } }
```

Instructions

Let’s make some modifications to our code.

Think about what instance fields you can create for the `Dog` class.

Try to add and remove instance fields. Create instances with different values. Access and print different fields.
