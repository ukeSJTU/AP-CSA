In the last lesson, we learned that objects have state and behavior. We have seen how to give objects state through instance fields. Now, we’re going to learn how to create object _behavior_ using

[methods](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/methods?page_ref=catalog)

. Remember our example of a Savings Account.

![A diagram of a software object with fields and behavior](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/diagram%20of%20an%20object-02.png)

The state tells us what a savings account should know:

-   The balance of money available

The behavior tells us what tasks a savings account should be able to perform:

-   Depositing - increasing the amount available
-   Withdrawing - decreasing the amount available
-   Checking the balance - displaying the amount available.

Methods are repeatable, modular blocks of code used to accomplish specific tasks. We have the ability to define our own methods that will take input, do something with it, and return the kind of output we want.

Looking at the example above, recreating a savings account is no easy task. How can one program tackle such a large problem? This is where methods with their ability to accomplish smaller, specific tasks come in handy. Through _method decomposition_, we can use methods to break down a large problem into smaller, more manageable problems.

Methods are also reusable. Imagine we wrote a sandwich-making program that used 20 lines of code to make a single sandwich. Our program would become very long very quickly if we were making multiple sandwiches. By creating a `makeSandwich()` method, we can make a sandwich anytime simply by calling it.

![makeSandwich() adds ingredients together to make a sandwich](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/revised-2019/methods-conceptual.gif)

In this lesson, we’ll learn how to create and call our very own methods inside of our programs.

**Keep Reading: AP Computer Science A Students**

If we were to share this sandwich-making program with another person, they wouldn’t have to understand _how_ `makeSandwich()` worked. If we wrote our program well, all they would need to know is that if they called `makeSandwich()`, they would receive a sandwich. This concept is known as _procedural abstraction_: knowing what a method does, but not how it accomplishes it.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Look at the code editor in the file **Main.java**. We have created a `Main` class with no method except `main()` and the class constructor.

    Run the code and observe the output.

    Notice that `main()` is very lengthy and contains many print statements. The repetitive code can be tedious to write if we need to make more than five deposits.

    In this lesson, we’ll learn how to make methods to deposit, withdraw, and check account balance for the `SavingsAccount` class.

    Hint

    First, think about what tasks we personally do with our bank accounts.

    We deposit, withdraw, and check our balance. To make this process easier, we’ll create methods for these tasks.

### Defining Methods

9 min

If we were to define a `checkBalance()`

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

for the Savings Account example we talked about earlier, it would look like the following:

```
public void checkBalance(){  System.out.println("Hello!");  System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);}
```

The first line, `public void checkBalance()`, is the method declaration. It gives the program some information about the method:

-   `public` means that other classes can access this method. We will learn more about that later in the course.
-   The

    Preview: Docs Loading link description

    [`void`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/void)

    keyword means that there is no specific output from the method. We will see methods that are not `void` later in this lesson, but for now, all of our methods will be `void`.

-   `checkBalance()` is the name of the method.

Every method has its own unique _method signature_ which is composed of the method’s name and its

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[parameter](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/parameter)

type. In this example, the method signature is `checkBalance()`.

The two print statements are inside the _body_ of the method, which is defined by the curly braces: `{` and `}`.

Anything we can do in our `main()` method, we can do in other methods! All of the Java tools you know, like the math and comparison operators, can be used to make interesting and useful methods.

**Keep Reading: AP Computer Science A Students**

`checkBalance()` is considered a non-static method because its signature does not include the keyword `static` like the `main()` method does. We’ll learn more about non-static methods later in this course.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    In the `Store` class, add a new method called `advertise()` that is accessible by other classes and does not return anything. Don’t add anything to the body of the method.

    Hint

    Here’s an example of how we would add a `bark()` method. It doesn’t return anything and is accessible by other classes:

    ```
    public void bark() { }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Well done! Let’s add some print statements inside our `advertise()` method. Print these two statements:

    ```pseudo
    "Come spend some money!"

    "Selling <productType>!"
    ```

    The value stored in the variable `<productType>` should be printed instead of “productType” string.

    Don’t worry if you are not able to see the output. We’ll learn how to use the `advertise()` method in later exercises.

    Hint

    We print the value stored in the variable `dogName` like this:

    ```
    System.out.println("The name of this dog is " + dogName + "!");
    ```

    Make sure to write your `print` statements within the curly braces of the `advertise()` method!

### Calling Methods

7 min

When we add a non-static

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

to a class, it becomes available to use on an object of that class. In order to have our methods get executed, we must _call_ the method on the object we created.

Let’s add a non-static `startEngine()` method to our `Car` class from the previous lesson. Inside the `main()` method, we’ll call `startEngine()` on the `myFastCar` object:

```
class Car {  String color;  public Car(String carColor) {    color = carColor;  }  public void startEngine() {    System.out.println("Starting the car!");    System.out.println("Vroom!");  }  public static void main(String[] args){    Car myFastCar = new Car("red");    // Call a method on an object     myFastCar.startEngine();    System.out.println("That was one fast car!");  }}
```

Let’s take a closer look at the method call:

```
myFastCar.startEngine();
```

First, we reference our object `myFastCar`. Then, we use the _dot operator_ (`.`) to call the method `startEngine()`. Note that we must include parentheses `()` after our method name in order to call it.

If we run the above program, we will get the following output.

```
Starting the car!Vroom!That was one fast car!
```

Code generally runs in a top-down order where code execution starts at the top of a program and ends at the bottom of a program; however, methods are ignored by the compiler unless they are being called.

When a method is called, the compiler executes every statement contained within the method. Once all method instructions are executed, the top-down order of execution continues. This is why `Starting the car!` and `Vroom!` are outputted before `That was one fast car!`.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Now our `Store` class has a new method called `advertise()`, but we didn’t see its output.

    In the `main()` method of **Main.java**, call the `advertise()` method of the `lemonadeStand` instance and observe the displayed output.

    Hint

    We call a method on an object using the dot operator. Take a look at the following example of how we called the `bark()` method of the `dog` instance:

    ```
    dog.bark();
    ```

    Remember to include the parentheses after the method name, as they are needed to call the method.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Now, replace the argument “Lemonade” with “Coffee” in the instance definition and run the code.

    Hint

    Here, we have created a new instance of the Animal class and passed in `Dogfood` as an argument to the constructor.

    ```
    Animal dog= new Animal("Dogfood");
    ```

A

is a task that an object of a class performs.

We mark the domain of this task using curly braces: `{`, and `}`. Everything inside the curly braces is part of the task. This domain is called the

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[_scope_](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/scope)

of a method.

We can’t access

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

that are declared inside a method in code that is outside the scope of that method.

Looking at the `Car` class again:

```
class Car {  String color;  int milesDriven;  public Car(String carColor) {    color = carColor;    milesDriven = 0;           }  public void drive() {     String message = "Miles driven: " + milesDriven;     System.out.println(message);  }  public static void main(String[] args){     Car myFastCar = new Car("red");     myFastCar.drive();  }}
```

The variable `message`, which is declared and initialized inside of `drive`, cannot be used inside of `main()`! It only exists within the _scope_ of the `drive()` method.

However, `milesDriven`, which is declared at the top of the class, can be used inside all methods in the class, since it is in the scope of the whole class.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Let’s see how the scope works!

    Inside the **Store.java** file, check out the `advertise()` method. Notice how we are using `productType`.

    Now, replace the `productType` variable with the `product` variable inside the `advertise()` method.

    When you run the code, you will notice an error has occurred. This is due to the `product` variable not being in the `advertise()` method’s scope. The variable `product` was declared in the constructor, so we are not able to access it.

    Hint

    Run the code to see the error.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    To correct the error from the previous checkpoint, in the `advertise()` method, change the `product` variable back to `productType`.

    Switch over to **Main.java** and run your code.

    Hint

    Replace the variable `cookie` with the variable `productType`.

We saw how a method’s

declared in one

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

in another method. What if we had some information in one method that we needed to pass into another method?

Similar to how we added parameters to _constructors_, we can customize all other methods to accept parameters. For example, in the following code, we create a `startRadio()` method that accepts a `double`

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[parameter](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/parameter)

, `stationNum`, and a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[`String`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

parameter called `stationName`:

```
class Car {  String color;  public Car(String carColor) {    color = carColor;          }  public void startRadio(double stationNum, String stationName) {    System.out.println("Turning on the radio to " + stationNum + ", " + stationName + "!");    System.out.println("Enjoy!");  }  public static void main(String[] args){    Car myCar = new Car("red");    myCar.startRadio(103.7, "Meditation Station");  }}
```

Adding parameter values impacts our method’s signature. Like constructor signatures, the method signature includes the method name as well as the parameter types of the method. The signature of the above method is `startRadio(double, String)`.

In the `main()` method, we call the `startRadio()` method on the `myCar` object and provide a `double`

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[argument](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/argument)

of `103.7` and `String` argument of `"Meditation Station"`, resulting in the following output:

```
Turning on the radio to 103.7, Meditation Station!Enjoy!
```

Note that when we call on a method with multiple parameters, the arguments given in the call must be placed in the same order as the parameters appear in the signature. If the argument types do not match the parameter types, we’ll receive an error.

**Keep Reading: AP Computer Science A Students**

Through method overloading, our Java programs can contain multiple methods with the same name as long as each method’s parameter list is unique. For example, we can recreate our above program to contain two `startRadio()` methods:

```
// Method 1public void startRadio(double stationNum, String stationName) {  System.out.println("Turning on the radio to " + stationNum + ", " + stationName + "!");  System.out.println("Enjoy!");}  // Method 2public void startRadio(double stationNum) {  System.out.println("Turning on the radio to " + stationNum + "!");}public static void main(String[] args){  Car myCar = new Car("red");  // Calls the first startRadio() method  myCar.startRadio(103.7, "Meditation Station");  // Calls the second startRadio() method  myCar.startRadio(98.2);}
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Let’s create a method to greet the customers.

    In Store.java, add a `greetCustomer()` method to the `Store` class that is accessible by other classes and does not return anything.

    > Note: it is okay to get an error regarding a missing `main()` method. The `main()` method is defined in **Main.java**.

    Hint

    Here, we create a `bark()` method that is accessible by other classes and does not return anything:

    ```
    public void bark(){ }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Now, add a `String` parameter to the `greetCustomer()` method called `customerName`.

    Hint

    We add the parameter `dogName` to a method signature like this:

    ```
    public void bark(String dogName){ }
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Inside `greetCustomer()`, print a string that has the following format:

    ```pseudo
    "Welcome to the store, " + customerName + "!"
    ```

    Hint

    We use `System.out.println()` to print “This dog is barking:” + dogName + “!”:

    ```
    System.out.println("This dog is barking:" + dogName + "!");
    ```

    Remember the string `This dog is barking` and `dogName` is concatenated inside the print statement using the addition operator (+).

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Inside the `main()` method of **Main.java**, call the greetCustomer() method on the `lemonadeStand` object. Pass in a name of your choice!

    Hint

    Here is how we can call a method of an object:

### Reassigning Instance Fields

12 min

Earlier, we thought about a Savings Account as a type of object we could represent in Java.

Two of the methods we need are depositing and withdrawing:

```
public class SavingsAccount{  double balance;  public SavingsAccount(double startingBalance){    balance = startingBalance;  }  public void deposit(double amountToDeposit){     //Add amountToDeposit to the balance  }  public void withdraw(double amountToWithdraw){     //Subtract amountToWithdraw from the balance  }  public static void main(String[] args){  }}
```

These methods would change the value of the variable `balance`. We can _reassign_ balance to be a new value by using our assignment operator, `=`, again.

```
public void deposit(double amountToDeposit){  double updatedBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;  balance = updatedBalance;}
```

Now, when we call `deposit()`, it should change the value of the instance field `balance`:

```
public static void main(String[] args){  SavingsAccount myAccount = new SavingsAccount(2000);  System.out.println(myAccount.balance);  myAccount.deposit(100);  System.out.println(myAccount.balance);}
```

This code first prints `2000`, the initial value of `myAccount.balance`, and then prints `2100`, which is the value of `myAccount.balance` after the `deposit()`

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

has run.

Changing instance fields is how we change the state of an object and make our objects more flexible and realistic.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    We have added a new instance field to our `Store` class called `price` and an empty `increasePrice()` method.

    Add a parameter `double priceToAdd` to the `increasePrice()` method.

    > Note: it is okay to get an error regarding a missing `main()` method. The `main()` method is defined in **Main.java**.

    Hint

    We write the parameters in the method signature like so:

    ```
    public void bark(double dogId){ }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    We need to create a variable to store the increased price of our product.

    Inside `increasePrice()`, create a new variable called `double newPrice` and set it equal to the addition of `price` and `priceToAdd`.

    newPrice\=price+priceToAddnewPrice = price + priceToAdd
    newPrice\=price+priceToAdd

    Hint

    We use the addition operator (+) to add the value of two variables.

    ```
    sum = variable1 + variable2;
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Inside the `increasePrice()` method, assign the `newPrice` to the instance field `price`.

    Hint

    We use the assignment operator (=) to assign a new value to a variable.

    Here, we assign `newDogId` to the `dogId` instance field:

    ```
    dogId = newDogId;
    ```

    This will update the value of `dogId`.

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Let’s use our `increasePrice()` method inside `main()` in **Main.java**.

    Increase the price of `lemonadeStand` by 1.50 using `increasePrice()` method.

    Print the instance field `price` to see the updated price of `lemonadeStand`.

    Hint

    To increase the number of dogs by 2 using the`increaseDogs()` method, we would do it like this:

    ```
    dogs.increaseDogs(2);
    ```

    Then, print the updated price using `System.out.println()`.

it was created in if we _return_ it from the method.

We return a value by using the keyword `return`:

```
public int numberOfTires() {   int tires = 4;   // return statement   return tires;}
```

This method, called `numberOfTires()`, returns `4`. Once the return statement is executed, the compiler exits the function. Any code that exists after the return statement in a function is ignored.

In past exercises, when creating new methods, we used the keyword

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[`void`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/void)

. Here, we are replacing `void` with `int`, to signify that the _return type_ is an `int`.

The void keyword (which means “completely empty”) indicates that no value is returned after calling that method.

A non-void method, like `numberOfTires()` returns a value when it is called. We can use datatype keywords (such as `int`, `char`, etc.) to specify the type of value the method should return. The return value’s type must match the return type of the method. If the return expression is compatible with the return type, a copy of that value gets returned in a process known as _return by value_.

Unlike void methods, non-void methods can be used as either a variable value or as part of an expression like so:

```
public static void main(String[] args){    Car myCar = new Car("red");    int numTires = myCar.numberOfTires();}
```

Within `main()`, we called the `numberOfTires()` method on `myCar`. Since the method returns an `int` value of `4`, we store the value in an integer variable called `numTires`. If we printed `numTires`, we would see `4`.

We learned how to return primitive values from a method, but what if we wanted our method to return an object? Returning an object works a little differently than returning a primitive value. When we return a primitive value, a copy of the value is returned; however, when we return an object, we return a reference to the object instead of a copy of it.

Let’s create a second class, `carLot`, that takes in a `Car` as a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[parameter](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/parameter)

and contains a method which returns a `Car` object.

```
class CarLot {    Car carInLot;    public CarLot(Car givenCar) {        carInLot = givenCar;    }    public Car returnACar() {        // return Car object        return carInLot;    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        Car myCar = new Car("red", 70);        System.out.println(myCar);         CarLot myCarLot = new CarLot(myCar);        System.out.println(myCarLot.returnACar());    }}
```

This code outputs the same memory address because `myCar` and `carInLot` have the same reference value:

```
Car@2f333739Car@2f333739
```

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Add a new method called `getPriceWithTax()` in the `Store` class that will return the price of the product including the tax.

    Set the return type to `double` to indicate that it returns a double value, and it should take in no parameters.

    For now, leave the body of the method empty.

    Hint

    We can create a `getNumBarks()` method that has a return type `double` and takes no parameters:

    ```
    public double getNumBarks(){ }
    ```

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    Inside the `Store` class, we have an instance field called `double tax` with the value of `0.08`.

    We need another variable to calculate the total price of the product including tax.

    Inside the `getPriceWithTax()` method, create a variable called `totalPrice` of type `double` and set it equal to the new price with tax. The formula for calculating a price with tax is the following:

    totalPrice\=price+price×taxtotalPrice = price + price \\times tax
    totalPrice\=price+price×tax

    > Note: for testing purposes, please write the formula exactly as we have shown it. The tests may fail otherwise.

    Hint

    We multiply two variables like so:

    ```
    Product = variable1 * variable2;
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    At the end of `getPriceWithTax()` method, return the variable `totalPrice`.

    Hint

    Check out this example of how we return the `numBarks` variable:

    ```
    return numBarks;
    ```

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Inside `main()` in **Main.java**, create a `double` variable `lemonadePrice` and set it to `lemonadeStand.getPriceWithTax()`.

    Also, print your results.

    Hint

    Remember, the value returned and the variable need to be of the same type to be able to store the returned value.

    We use the `bark()` on the `dog` instance and set its returned value to `numBarks`.

    ```
    double numBarks = dog.bark();
    ```

### The toString() Method

13 min

When we print out Objects, we often see a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[String](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/string)

that is not very helpful in determining what the Object represents. In the last lesson, we saw that when we printed our `Store` objects, we would see output like:

```
Store@6bc7c054
```

where `Store` is the name of the object and `6bc7c054` is its position in memory.

This doesn’t tell us anything about what the `Store` sells, the price, or the other instance fields we’ve defined. We can add a

Preview: Docs Loading link description

[method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

to our classes that makes this printout more descriptive.

When we define a _toString()_ method for a class, we can return a `String` that will print when we print the object:

```
class Car {    String color;    public Car(String carColor) {        color = carColor;    }    public static void main(String[] args){        Car myCar = new Car("red");        System.out.println(myCar);    }   public String toString(){       return "This is a " + color + " car!";   }}
```

When this runs, the command `System.out.println(myCar)` will print `This is a red car!`, which tells us about the Object `myCar`.

Instructions

1.  Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    The `Store` class currently does not contain a custom definition of `toString()`. Let’s see what happens when we call `System.out.println()` on two instances of `Store`.

    Call `System.out.println()` on `lemonadeStand` and `cookieShop` inside the `main()` method of **Main.java**.

    Hint

    Here is an example of how we to call `System.out.println()` on an object:

    ```
    System.out.println(someObject);
    ```

    Use this on `lemonadeStand` and `cookieShop`.

2.  Checkpoint 2 Passed

    2.

    When we print our objects, we want them to return a meaningful and informative string.

    Create a `toString()` method inside the `Store` class. Leave it empty for now.

    > Note: It is okay to get an error in the output claiming that `toString()` should return a `String`. You will fill out the `toString()` method in the next step.

    Hint

    To create a `toString()` method, define it within the `Store` class. Remember, it should be `public`, return a String, and take no parameters. We can create a `toString()` method for the Dog class like so:

    ```
    public class Dog {   public String toString(){  } }
    ```

3.  Checkpoint 3 Passed

    3.

    Fill in the `toString()` method of the `Store` class such that it returns this string:

    “This store sells <productType> at a price of <price>.”

    Where <productType> and <price> are the values in the instance fields of the same name.

    For example, if we had a hat store implementation of `Store` where hats cost 8, the string would be:

    ```pseudo
    This store sells hats at a price of 8.
    ```

    > Note: If you click “Run” while you still have the **Store.java** file open, you will get an error in the output regarding a missing `main()` method. This is an okay error to get because the method is located in the **Main.java** file.

    Hint

    We need to concatenate the String `This store sells` with the instance fields `productType` and `price`.

    We can concatenate them using the addition operator (+).

    Remember, you can access these instance variables directly within the method as they belong to the same class.

4.  Checkpoint 4 Passed

    4.

    Open **Main.java** and click “Run”.

    Do our objects give us information about them?

    Hint

    To evaluate if the outputs are more helpful now, try to answer the following: Do they give you more information about the `Store` objects, such as what they sell and their prices? If yes, then the `toString()` method has successfully improved the printouts.

Great work! Methods are a powerful way to abstract tasks away and make them repeatable. They allow us to define behavior for classes, so that the Objects we create can do the things we expect them to. Let’s review everything we have learned about methods so far.

-   _Defining a method_ :

    [Method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/method)

    declarations will declare a method’s return type, name, and parameters

-   _Calling a method_ : Methods are invoked with a `.` and `()`
-   _Parameters_ : Inputs to the method and their types are declared in parentheses in the method signature
-   _Changing Instance Fields_ : Methods can be used to change the value of an instance field

    [Variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/julia/variables)

    only exist within the domain that they are created in

-   _Return_ : The type of the variables that will be output are declared in the method declaration

As you move through more Java material, it will be helpful to frame the tasks you create in terms of methods. This will help you think about what inputs you might need and what output you expect.
