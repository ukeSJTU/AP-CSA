## Questions

What is the _call stack_?

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Incorrect:

    A data structure typically abstracted away from us which is unnecessary when using iteration.

    The call stack contains each recursive call with the function‚Äôs execution context, but it also contains iterative functions.

-   A data structure typically abstracted away from us which retrieves recursive calls from the computer‚Äôs RAM.
-   A data structure typically abstracted away from us which stores additional memory when necessary.
-   A data structure typically abstracted away from us which stores function calls in programs.

## Questions

What is the purpose of the base case in a recursive function?

## Answer Choices

-   In the base case, the function‚Äôs values are returned.
-   In the base case, the function recurses one step closer to terminating.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    In the base case, there is no recursive function call.

    üëè

    Correct! We can think of the base case like the terminating condition of an iterative loop.

-   In the base case, the function switches from base 10 to base 2.

## Questions

When analyzing the Big O runtime of recursive functions, we count the \_\_\_\_.

## Answer Choices

-   Relationship of input to stack overflows.
-   Relation of input to function calls.

    Correct answer

-   Relation of input to loop iterations.
-   (Selected)Incorrect:

    Relationship of input to base cases.

    The relationship of function calls to input size determines the Big O runtime.

## Questions

A function will not recurse if the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is reached.

## Answer Choices

-   Best case.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    Base case.

    üëè

    Correct! The recursive step will bring us closer to the base case, where no recursion takes place.

-   Divide step.
-   Recursive step.

## Questions

What are the two main sections of a recursive function?

## Answer Choices

-   The base case and the basest case.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    The base case and the recursive step.

    üëè

    Correct! The base case has no recursive call and the recursive step has a recursive call that moves closer to the base case.

-   The recursive step and the termination phase.
-   The base case and the repeating step.

## Questions

What is an _execution context_ and how does it relate to recursion?

## Answer Choices

-   (Selected)Correct:

    An execution context contains the variables within each recursive function call.

    üëè

    Correct! Separate recursive calls each have their own variables.

-   An execution context contains the function definition without additional arguments to recursive function calls.
-   An execution context contains the total amount of recursive function calls.
-   An execution context contains the iterations within the initial function call.

## Questions

Recursion is typically more efficient than iteration.

## Answer Choices

-   True.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    False.

    üëè

    Correct! Recursion has additional overhead of function frames on the call stack.

## Questions

A recursive function which has no base case, or a recursive step that does not lead to the base case, will cause what?

## Answer Choices

-   A queue overflow.
-   A queue underflow.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    A stack overflow.

    üëè

    Correct! Recursive calls will fill the call stack until there is no room left.

-   A stack underflow.

## Questions

What is the importance of the _recursive step_?

## Answer Choices

-   It retrieves a return value.
-   It removes one element from a list.
-   It prevents a stack overflow.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    It recursively calls the function with an argument which will reach the base case.

    üëè

    Correct! The recursive step will be the equivalent of an infinite loop and cause a stack overflow if it doesn‚Äôt move closer to a base case.

## Questions

Which of the following describes a recursive approach?

## Answer Choices

-   To print the spelling of a name, use a for loop with an index variable to access each letter.
-   To compute a factorial number, declare a result variable and loop through each number from 1 to the input number, storing the product of that number with result.
-   To iterate through a list, create a counting variable which is incremented through the length of the list.
-   (Selected)Correct:

    To compute a factorial number, multiply the number by the factorial number minus one.

    üëè

    Correct! This is recursive because we‚Äôre describing the problem in terms of itself.
