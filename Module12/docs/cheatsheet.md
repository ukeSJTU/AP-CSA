### Base Case of a Recursive Function

A recursive function should have a base case with a condition that stops the function from recursing indefinitely. In the example, the base case is a condition evaluating a negative or zero value to be true.

function countdown(value)

if value is negative or zero

    print "done"

otherwise if value is greater than zero

    print value

    call countdown with (value-1)

to clipboard

### Recursive Step in Recursive Function

A recursive function should have a **recursive step** which calls the recursive function with some input that brings it closer to its base case. In the example, the recursive step is the call to `countdown()` with a decremented value.

def countdown(value):

if value <= 0:

    print("done")

else:

    print(value)

    countdown(value\-1)  #recursive step

to clipboard

### What is Recursion

Recursion is a strategy for solving problems by defining the problem in terms of itself. A recursive function consists of two basic parts: the base case and the recursive step.

### Call Stack in Recursive Function

Programming languages use a facility called a **call stack** to manage the invocation of recursive functions. Like a stack, a call stack for a recursive function calls the last function in its stack when the **base case** is met.

![An animation showing how to calculate the factorial of 4 using a call stack.](https://content.codecademy.com/practice/art-for-practice/stackcall.gif)An animation showing how to calculate the factorial of 4 using a call stack., playing

### Big-O Runtime for Recursive Functions

The big-O runtime for a recursive function is equivalent to the number of recursive function calls. This value varies depending on the complexity of the algorithm of the recursive function. For example, a recursive function of input N that is called N times will have a runtime of O(N). On the other hand, a recursive function of input N that calls itself twice per function may have a runtime of O(2^N).

### Weak Base Case in Recursive Function

A recursive function with a weak base case will not have a condition that will stop the function from recursing, causing the function to run indefinitely. When this happens, the call stack will overflow and the program will generate a _stack overflow_ error.

### Execution Context of a Recursive Function

An execution context of a recursive function is the set of arguments to the recursive function call. Programming languages use execution contexts to manage recursive functions.
